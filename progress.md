Original prompt: 先继续优化都市人生 simsapp：去掉 pics 里的丑像素家具/房屋贴图，改成自己画的像素图；并把“吃瓜”从单纯调用 API 引导 char 行动，升级为随机触发“角色剧情”或“主线剧情”，主线剧情要有明显标题和附件栏，附件可包含图片、道具、证据、同人文等。

2026-09-12 — SAR NPC opt-out covers dependent features
- Explicit hide now suppresses room titles, warehouse title editor/keepsakes, collection roster/exclusive tabs and NPC-only egg/chimera entries. Existing unlocks, titles, coins, inventory and chat history are retained for re-enable. Active roster exits immediately, including cross-tab changes; rewind entry is hidden while off.
- Added shared sarNpcPreference leaf gate and same-page setting event. Normal chat omits NPC public background/title injection; activity title instructions and in-flight title application are gated. Personal-line offers/advancement and undelivered Easter-egg messages pause while disabled.
- Fishing and garden use neutral facility wording when off; fish sales still settle at market prices without Aiven dialogue/art. Help text follows the same setting. General chips/modules/fish/dinosaurs remain available.
- New preference unit tests and isolated browser script scripts/test-sar-npc-off.mjs cover opt-out prompts, unchanged collection data, recovery receipts, cross-tab UI transitions and restored progress. Browser run passed; screenshots of off collection, warehouse and official skill room inspected under output/sar-npc-off. No real user storage modified, no commit or push.

2026-09-12 — SAR economy second calibration
- Paid permanent-chip draws now cost 90 (was 30); UI explanatory text uses the same constant. Kept two free draws/day, 120 starting wallets, 180 personal buyback and 18–34 consumable module prices. No extra fishing delay or existing-asset clawback.
- Each pool separately persists a duplicate streak: after two owned draws, the next chooses uniformly among unowned chips, resetting on a new chip. Free and paid both count; complete pools remain drawable. Legacy saves start the counter at zero. The counter commits atomically with wallet/inventory/receipt and survives backup/restore.
- Free claims now require a later local date, preventing backward-clock replenishment. Old 30-coin quotes reject rather than charging 90 silently; receipt retries remain idempotent.
- 63 tests passed across gacha, commerce, economy, backup, collection, discounts and facility guides. Fixed a date-dependent existing concurrency test by freezing Date.now to its fixture date. Real browser commerce checks passed for 90-coin costs, double clicks, reload, install, zero-balance free draw, cross-tab spending and failed writes. Official skill client ran; inspected its guide screenshot and the paid-draw screenshot. Artifacts: output/sar-economy-audit and output/fishing-qa/sar-commerce.
- Updated economy/user docs and VRWorld README. Remaining design consideration: more character IDs still expand total startup funds and personal daily buyback supply; independent-wallet rules were not redesigned in this calibration. No changes to other pending personal-line/UI work; no commit or push in this turn.

2026-09-10 — SAR bulletin-board gameplay audit
- Current request: inspect the remaining SAR bulletin-board gameplay. Baseline: 60 fishing/market/session/real-DB tests pass.
- Reproduced by inspection: anonymous owners lose their alias when replying; item requests automatically surrender the first matching specimen; model listings omit whether goods are real or textual. Adding focused regressions and explicit specimen selection, with archive details retained.
- Existing pnpm launcher tries to reinstall dependencies and then cannot resolve the test binary with verification disabled; direct Node execution of the already-installed Vitest works without changing dependencies.
- Browser checks use isolated fixtures and mocked data, with no real model calls or user storage.
- Completed: owner replies inherit the post alias; item fulfillment accepts an exact catch ID and rejects missing/stale/ambiguous selections; model and UI expose real/text goods plus specimen size, quality and nickname. New listings and fulfilled requests retain specimen snapshots; detail sheets show transaction counterparties. Legacy archives remain readable without invented specimen history.
- Validation: all 162 tests in the VR-related run pass (14 suites), including five new market regressions. Dedicated market browser checks cover purchase, tips, favor fulfillment, chosen/stale specimens, anonymous replies, expiry, archive and reload at 390/320 px. Real OS/SAR entry/water/board round trips pass after repairing the old room-image test selector. Official game client state/screenshot and stable mobile detail screenshots inspected; no UI errors in the isolated checks.
- Vite production build passes (6,227 modules, 48.66 s) into ignored output/fishing-qa/market-build. Full TypeScript check still reports errors in other files; no diagnostics in the changed feature files. Existing chunk-cycle/pdf.js build warnings remain.
- Boundaries retained: request prices are not escrowed; market DM share remains inside the activity card. Real LLM behavior was not evaluated. Changes are local and uncommitted; no push/deployment. No remaining blockers for this audit.

2026-03-19
- Removed the hardcoded building PNG override in `utils/tinyTownTiles.ts` so LifeSim now uses generated pixel-style town tiles instead of `pics` house textures.
- Added story attachment types, world-drama prompt helpers, fallback attachment generation, and `materializeStoryAttachments` so main-plot events can drop image/item/evidence/fanfic payloads.
- Added `apps/lifesim/StoryAttachments.tsx` for compact attachment cards plus a modal detail viewer.
- Wired `apps/LifeSimApp.tsx` so `吃瓜` now randomly branches into either normal char-driven drama or a no-char main-plot event from `主线编剧室`.
- Seeded replay actions correctly for the new branch and moved `runCharTurns` above the user action handlers to avoid referencing it before initialization.
- Added a no-API fallback for char turns so the sim no longer gets stuck when external model settings are empty; chars will still produce lightweight “围观” replay entries.
- Updated the drama feed and replay overlay to surface main-plot badges, headlines, and attachment shelves.
- `npm run build` passes after the LifeSim changes.
- Automated Playwright validation is currently blocked because `C:\Users\tiaotiao\.codex\skills\develop-web-game\scripts\web_game_playwright_client.js` cannot resolve the `playwright` package in this environment.
- Added drama filters (`全部 / 角色 / 主线 / 系统`) and changed the normal drama log to keep the full scrollable history instead of truncating to 50.
- Added a LifeSim settings panel for selecting which external characters are allowed to participate in the sim.
- Added long-press NPC editing so residents can be edited in-place for this run (name / gender / personality / bio / backstory).
- Replaced the browser-native reset confirm with a custom retro dialog that can either reset directly or generate a LifeSim ending summary card before resetting.
- Added a new `lifesim_reset_card` score-card payload and wired it through chat rendering plus readable archive/context formatting in Chat / Character / chat prompt history.
- Text attachments like fanfic/evidence now surface the original text as the primary reading area in the attachment modal.
- Adjusted `apps/lifesim/DramaFeed.tsx` so main-plot actions also remain visible in the left-hand dynamic stream under `全部 / 主线`, instead of being excluded from `drama.log`.
- Restyled the LifeSim reset summary card in `components/chat/MessageItem.tsx` to look more like the game's retro pseudo-window UI (sharper borders, title bar, grid texture, status bar).
- `npm run build` still passes after the latest DramaFeed + chat-card styling changes.
- Automated browser validation is still blocked locally because `require('playwright')` fails with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

2026-08-17 — Qixi visual retheme
- Current request: rebuild the Qixi entry screen to match the supplied celestial poster reference, then retheme the in-game surfaces using the supplied deep-purple / lavender / blush-gold fantasy palette.
- Constraints: preserve the existing Qixi memory-generation and smart-context behavior; visual/layout changes only unless a UI integration fix is required.
- Visual thesis: a full-screen storybook night poster with deep plum space, lavender mist, cream moonlight, and restrained blush-gold ornament.
- Planned validation: Qixi entry at mobile and desktop sizes, then fake chat and first interlayer screens; inspect screenshots, render_game_to_text, and console errors.

- Removed LifeSim's autonomous NPC interaction step from the main turn flow, so only user-triggered actions and char/main-plot API turns advance the story now.
- Added LifeSim-specific independent API settings with global preset loading and a Gemini Flash recommendation, and persisted them on the LifeSim state so city resets do not wipe the app-specific config.
- Reworked `apps/lifesim/DramaFeed.tsx` again so `主线历史` appears above the current main-plot detail view, while keeping the archive separate from the general drama stream.
- Tightened LifeSim scroll behavior across the main panel, settings panel, action panel, and attachment viewer by hiding scrollbars and blocking horizontal overflow except for the attachment strip itself.
- `npm run build` passes after the latest LifeSim logic + layout + settings changes.

TODO
- If local browser testing is possible, verify both `吃瓜 -> 角色剧情` and `吃瓜 -> 主线剧情` paths and inspect attachment modal behavior.
- Install or provide `playwright` if automated screenshot-based UI validation is needed later.

2026-09-06 — 彼方钓鱼与本地市场板（进行中）
- Current request: implement the fishing system and bulletin-board market together inside the SAR activity space.
- Settled scope: each user's world owns its own market simulation; user and every character have separate persistent money, inventory, listings, requests, comments, and transaction history. Random passersby are local simulated actors. No market post/comment data is uploaded to Cloudflare.
- Weather boundary: fishing uses the existing real-perception weather when enabled and available; otherwise it uses a stable locally simulated daily weather, visibly labeled in the fishing UI.
- Gameplay boundary: user fishing is an original tide/resonance catch game inspired only by the abstract keep-in-zone mechanic; character fishing rolls the canonical catch in code, then uses one LLM call for reaction and post-catch choice.
- Signal-poetry boundary: the event is already ended; preserve the existing memorial output but later hard-freeze all write paths rather than relying only on the front-end ended flag.
- Validation plan: focused state tests, production build, then the required web-game Playwright client with deterministic `render_game_to_text` / `advanceTime`; if its known missing Playwright dependency still blocks it, document and use the available browser/UI fallback.
- First implementation slice landed: `vr_fishing_market_v1` owns per-actor wallets, catches, discovery, world-seeded daily prices, listings, requests, comments and a bounded ledger; it is included in SAR local backup and never leaves the device.
- Added an original circular-sonar “潮汐共振” canvas game with pointer/Space input, deterministic automation hooks and visible real-vs-simulated weather provenance. The catalog includes ordinary fish plus the 12 Aiven dinosaur/time-layer relics.
- Enabled the SAR `水域与布告板` facility. Moved the ended Signal Fall entry off page one and into a small read-only card on the new page-three `往期活动` archive.

2026-08-31 — 彼方 SAR 活动室开场（进行中）
- Current request: add the one-time `更新 · 彼方活动室` notice, let users explicitly show or hide the fixed NPCs Caian/Aiven, focus the second room page when welcomed, and implement the supplied first-meeting branching dialogue before building the three facilities.
- Visual thesis: a restrained dark-violet in-world update event, followed by a sparse galgame dialogue surface; placeholder NPC silhouettes are deliberately isolated so later expression/portrait assets can replace them without rewriting the dialogue state machine.
- Interaction thesis: two-step update consent, one-line-at-a-time dialogue, and a softly bouncing quest mark; unfinished dialogue remains replayable and only the final line clears the quest state.
- Added a versioned local SAR state model and the complete supplied dialogue graph as fixed front-end data. NPC visibility and `Caian met` are persisted separately.
- Added the SAR room to page two, a no-art placeholder scene, an NPC visibility control under `接入`, and front-end-only NPC rendering that does not enter prompts, dynamic cards, or memories.

TODO — SAR opening
- Completed the welcome path at 390×844: update notice → NPC choice → automatic page-two focus → SAR room → Caian quest mark → one-line dialogue → choices.
- Verified that closing dialogue mid-way preserves the quest mark, completing the short branch clears it, hiding NPCs leaves the room usable, and re-enabling returns to page two without replaying the completed introduction.
- Inspected update, preference, page-two, dialogue, and room screenshots. Removed duplicated placeholder wall/NPC layers found during visual QA. No new console errors; only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning appeared.
- Focused SAR tests pass (3 tests). Vite production build passes with 6,169 modules transformed using an isolated temporary output directory.
- Full `pnpm run build` remains blocked before Vite because the existing `public/instant-worker.bundle.js` cannot be overwritten in this environment; no worker source or bundle was changed for SAR.
- Project-wide TypeScript reports the already-known unrelated errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, tests, apiCallLog, Qixi, camera emotion, worldbook, and Vite proxy typing; no SAR/VRWorld error was reported.
- The official web-game client remains unavailable because its own install cannot resolve `playwright`; in-app browser DOM/screenshot validation was used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Replace the isolated `C` / `A` stand-ins with the user's layered portraits and expression map when supplied.
- Implement only the next user-selected facility; the three current labels are non-interactive scene placeholders.

2026-08-31 — SAR 第二页改为完整活动空间 + 剧情回档
- Removed the nested SAR room-entry concept from the world grid. Page one now contains only the six existing public rooms; page two directly renders the full-height SAR activity space, so Caian, Aiven, the quest mark, and all three facility placeholders are immediately present without another room transition.
- Removed the obsolete 糯米鸡研发中心 card from world pagination. The underlying legacy room id remains type-compatible for old data, but it is no longer exposed as a world page card.
- Kept characters whose persisted/current room is `sar` visible in a compact “接入中的玩家” shelf on the SAR page.
- Added a guarded “剧情回档” control under 接入 → 活动空间 NPC. It resets only `caianMet` and the recorded first reaction; update acknowledgement and the user's NPC visibility choice remain unchanged. With NPCs visible it returns directly to page two and restores Caian's quest mark.
- Verified the full path at 390×844: update notice → welcome NPCs → automatic page-two focus → Caian short branch completion → quest mark cleared → settings rewind confirmation → automatic page-two return → quest mark restored. Also verified NPC hiding leaves the gacha/module/fishing areas visible.
- Inspected SAR page screenshots at both 390×844 and 390×667; the full scene and pager remain visible without overflow. Browser console had no new errors, only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning.
- Focused SAR tests pass (4 tests). Isolated Vite production build passes with 6,169 modules transformed. Project-wide TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated errors; no VRWorld/SAR error was added.
- The official web-game client was attempted again but its own installation still cannot resolve `playwright`; in-app browser DOM/screenshot validation was used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Replace the isolated `C` / `A` stand-ins with the user's layered portraits and expression map when supplied.
- Implement only the next user-selected facility; the three current labels are intentionally non-interactive.

2026-09-01 — SAR 人格推演双卡池（进行中）
- Current request: implement the first gacha slice before further detail work—two daily-free pools, a CSS-only machine/capsule/opening sequence, and a collection space. The 50-turn LLM simulation remains explicitly out of scope for this slice.
- Visual thesis: an occult research terminal rather than a casino—near-black navy, etched hairline frames, muted mineral accents, restrained geometric sigils, and one strong machine action per screen.
- Content plan: 25 `人格异格` modules define who the character became; 24 `剧情模板` modules define the world rule or incident. Relationship memory remains available to the future director layer while each module controls what the character acknowledges in-scene.
- Interaction thesis: each pool owns one independent free draw per local day; claiming persists immediately, then the user watches a mechanical CSS draw, taps the capsule open, and files the result into a duplicate-stacking collection.
- Added `utils/vrWorld/sarGacha.ts` with the complete 49-module catalog, safe versioned local state, independent daily counters, immediate draw history, and duplicate counts. Added focused state tests in `utils/sarGacha.test.ts`.
- Added `apps/vrWorld/SARGacha.tsx` and connected the SAR-page gacha facility. The full-screen device, accelerating coordinate rings, falling capsule, user-triggered split-open sequence, eight muted card accents, etched borders, sigils, reveal screen, collection grid, and detail sheet are CSS-only; no temporary raster art was added.
- Collection detail exposes the module rule and director-layer memory policy. The `启动推演` action is visibly reserved for the next slice, so this build never calls an LLM or begins the 50-interaction lifespan.
- Verified the complete flow at 390×844 for both pools: enter device → draw → capsule → manual open → reveal → collection → detail. Verified the reveal and machine states again at 390×667; controls remain above the bottom safe area. Both same-day draws become unavailable independently. Browser console showed only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning.
- Focused SAR tests pass (9 tests across intro and gacha state), and the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,171 modules transformed. The project-wide TypeScript check remains blocked by the previously recorded unrelated errors; none reference `VRWorldApp`, `SARClubEvent`, `SARGacha`, or `sarGacha`.
- The required web-game Playwright client was attempted and remains unavailable because its own installation cannot resolve `playwright`; in-app browser DOM and screenshot validation was used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Review and refine the 49 module titles/descriptions, draw pacing, collection density, and whether each pool should retain one daily free draw before implementing character binding and 50-turn LLM simulation.

2026-09-01 — SAR 异格陈列柜与推演初始化（进行中）
- Diagnosed the reported history-import leak: SAR announcement, first-meeting, gacha, and future simulation state lived only in `localStorage`, while backup import replaced IndexedDB history without touching those keys. Added a versioned `sarLocalState` backup payload. New text/full backups carry all three states; importing an older main-history backup with no SAR payload clears the current device's SAR keys, while explicit `media_only` imports preserve them.
- Added focused backup regressions covering old-history replacement, media-only preservation, and explicit SAR restore. All 14 focused SAR tests pass.
- Visual thesis: the new cabinet is a quieter companion instrument beside the gacha machine—one selected character portrait held between two etched module sockets, with the assembly relationship more important than decoration.
- Content plan: character rail → two module slots → single start action → generated IF dossier and opening scene; recent records remain secondary context.
- Interaction thesis: selecting a portrait reorients the cabinet, each socket opens only its matching owned-module shelf, and starting the LLM runs a single scanning/locking motion before unfolding the generated dossier.
- Added the simulation domain pipeline: character/world/relationship context is assembled through the same smart chat context path as 彼方, API priority remains character override → 彼方 API → chat API, and one structured LLM call generates a character-specific blueprint plus the scene-zero opening. Successful results persist as independent 0/50 IF records without modifying main-chat history.
- Added `apps/vrWorld/SARAssemblyCabinet.tsx` and a new `异格陈列柜` facility beside the gacha machine. The SAR footer is now a 2×2 facility matrix; Caian/Aiven were moved upward so the extra row does not cover them.
- The cabinet exposes every imported character in a horizontal portrait rail. It loads only owned modules into the matching `人格异格` / `剧情模板` sockets, never consumes the collection copy, and enables the LLM start action only after a character and both slots are selected. Existing combinations are saved as independent simulation dossiers and can be reopened from the cabinet archive.
- The generated dossier includes the character-specific divergence, world-template translation, in-scene memory behavior, scene-zero prose, first character line, response hook, and explicit `0 / 50` lifespan. Online/offline interaction remains the next pipe; the dossier action labels that honestly instead of faking a chat.
- Verified SAR page, character selection, both module pickers, locked two-slot state, and enabled start CTA at 390×844; repeated the ready-to-start layout at 390×667. No new browser errors appeared; only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning. The real start button was not fired during QA because that would transmit the user's character and relationship memory to their configured model.
- Focused SAR tests pass (15 tests), including blueprint parsing, prompt memory rules, API priority, old-backup reset, media-only preservation, gacha quotas, and intro state. Isolated Vite production build passes with 6,174 modules transformed. The required external Playwright client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` package; in-app browser screenshots and DOM checks were used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Wire the active dossier into the actual 50-interaction online/offline simulation chat, then add emergency archive and the later module-shop restart/true-start items.

2026-09-01 — SAR 异格身份卡与人格钢印
- Current request: separate人格异格 from ordinary剧情模式. The first LLM call now forges a collectible character-specific identity card; only after that card exists can the user start one independent 0/50 simulation life.
- Visual thesis: a restrained research-certificate card with a cold cyan identity frame and one warm, fingerprint-like steel-seal block as the dominant visual anchor. Long character material stays in a quiet vertical dossier instead of becoming a grid of decorative cards.
- Content plan: character source + personality patch + simulation field → permanent identity card → optional 0/50 run. The card carries identity, life patch, relationship, memory stance, steel seal, unavoidable cost, stable behavioral shift, and scene-zero entry.
- Interaction thesis: module sockets lock first; a staged scan forges the card; the card reveal makes the steel seal visually unmistakable; a separate `启动首次推演` action changes the entry from `DORMANT` to `0 / 50` without spending or duplicating the collectible card.
- Upgraded SAR simulation storage from the legacy `records[]` model to version 2 `cards[] + runs[]`. Legacy blueprints are read compatibly and split into one migrated identity card plus their original run, preserving progress and timestamps.
- Rewrote the LLM contract around人格编译 rather than plot generation. The personality module is now an人生/决策补丁母体; the former剧情模板 is presented as an `演算场` that supplies pressure, world rules, and initial position. The prompt requires a steel seal and patch cost and forbids prewriting later plot nodes or endings.
- Added a reusable runtime prompt builder that injects the full identity card, steel seal, patch cost, behavioral shift, and current interaction count into every future turn. It explicitly allows conflict and wavering while forbidding sudden cures, patch cancellation, or unexplained reversion to the base character.
- Rebuilt the cabinet result as a collectible identity card with a prominent steel-seal block, permanent collection count, full dossier sections, and a separate first-run action. Starting a card creates exactly one active 0/50 instance; repeat clicks return that instance instead of duplicating it.
- Updated visible gacha/cabinet language from `人格异格 / 剧情模板` to `人格补丁 / 演算场` while retaining the existing `variant-* / story-*` IDs so old draws and backups remain compatible.
- Verification: 18 focused SAR tests pass with cache disabled, covering structured-card parsing, steel-seal runtime injection, v1 migration, card/run separation, backup restore, card pools, and intro state. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,174 modules transformed. Full TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated project errors; no SAR file is present in the error list.
- Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised the real cabinet path, both owned-module pickers, ready-to-forge state, exact card component, dormant → 0/50 transition, and disabled next-round handoff. The card preview used fixed local test data, made no model request, and sent no character memory. No new browser error appeared; only the existing Tailwind CDN development warning was logged.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Implement the actual per-turn online/offline simulation chat using `buildSARIdentityRuntimePrompt`, increment the active run only for completed user interactions, and stop at 50.
- Add emergency archive, then connect the later 凯恩 restart / true-start shop items without allowing a plain free rerun.

2026-03-21
- Added a new global chat appearance setting, [0mchatAvatarMode[0m, so users can choose between grouped avatars and showing an avatar on every message.
- Rebuilt components/appearance/ChatAppearanceEditor.tsx into a clean modular version and updated the live preview so repeated-message avatar behavior is visible before applying.
- Wired the new avatar mode into pps/Chat.tsx and components/chat/MessageItem.tsx, including React.memo comparisons so appearance toggles reliably re-render existing messages.
- 
pm run build passes after the chat-avatar-frequency changes.
- Playwright validation is still blocked locally because the skill client cannot resolve the playwright package in this environment (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND).

- Updated chat message grouping in pps/Chat.tsx so consecutive messages now split not only by sender role but also by a 30-minute time gap, preventing early messages from visually merging into much later ones on either side of the conversation.
- 
pm run build passes after the time-gap grouping fix.

2026-08-17 — Qixi visual retheme completed
- Rebuilt the Qixi entry screen as a full-screen celestial storybook poster with visible brand/exit, moon phases, oversized title, oval CTA, and status copy.
- Applied a cohesive deep-plum, lavender, blush, and cream-moonlight palette through fake chat, distortion, interlayer, exploration, core, touch, and ending screens without changing story or memory logic.
- Verified the desktop entry and the mobile cover → fake chat → distortion → interlayer entry → first exploration sequence with rendered screenshots; no console or page errors were reported.
- `utils/qixiMemoryBundle.test.ts` passes (2 tests) and the production build succeeds.

2026-08-17 — Qixi dual-layer story rewrite
- Original prompt for this rewrite: read `qixi_reworked (1).md`, expand the inadequate 2–5 memory-anchor design, and implement the approved Qixi rewrite list.
- Visual thesis: a deep-plum context interlayer where User and Char are represented by two restrained text colors, with one shared ritual object dominating each full-screen scene.
- Content plan: preserve the celestial entry/fake chat/rabbit door, then run seven evidence-backed dual-layer rituals, form the bridge, reveal Char for the first time, hold to touch, and return to ordinary chat.
- Interaction thesis: the other-layer color gradually appears; shared objects visibly move from the unseen side; seven traces converge into one bridge transition. Keep copy and controls sparse.
- Implementation order: v2 material schema and recall, v7 game state/scenes, reunion generation and portrait fallback, touch/return-to-chat, tests/build/Playwright screenshots.
- Do not fabricate memories to satisfy anchor counts. Rich context targets 12–18 evidence anchors (cap 24); sparse context degrades personalization instead.

TODO — Qixi rewrite
- Replace qixi memory bundle v1 and invalidate stale per-character cache.
- Replace fixed NPC nodes, early reveal copy, 5+3 hidden gate, fixed four-page core, finalEcho, long touch monologue, and repeated ending thesis.
- Preserve the existing full-screen art direction and deterministic `render_game_to_text` / `advanceTime` hooks.

2026-08-17 — Qixi v2 material layer
- Replaced the 2–5-anchor v1 bundle with evidence (target 12–18, cap 24), typed artifacts (cap 40), seven scene payloads, per-scene personalization flags, and context-signature cache invalidation.
- Expanded source gathering to 160 recent messages plus three focused memory-palace recalls covering difficult emotions, wishes/future, and daily objects/language.
- Added local per-scene fallback content so sparse/invalid model output does not invent memories or make the activity unplayable.
- Added parser tests for rich evidence retention, hard caps/provenance filtering, and sparse response rejection. All 3 assertions pass; Vitest then hits an environment-only EPERM writing `node_modules/.vite/vitest/results.json`.

2026-08-17 — Qixi dual-layer rewrite implemented and browser-verified
- Replaced the old exploration/core/final-echo structure with a v7 flow: celestial cover, fake chat, CSS white-rabbit door, interlayer entry, seven shared-object scenes, bridge, generated reunion, hold-to-touch, short ending, and return to ordinary chat.
- Each of the seven scenes now has its own dominant CSS/SVG object, User action, independently rendered other-layer action, reveal, and saved decision; the word-cloud scene requires three selections and supports separate User/Char colors.
- Added a separate final reunion generator with technical-language and coercive-promise filtering plus portrait priority `Live2D -> meeting sprite -> static avatar -> chibi/initial fallback`.
- The ending saves one deduplicated assistant chat message, marks the special-moment record complete, selects the character, opens Chat, and now auto-returns reliably even when the OS parent re-renders.
- Added image-load fallback, removed a visible `Char` placeholder from sparse-context copy, replaced the missing-glyph rabbit with a CSS silhouette, and made bridge line angles valid CSS variables.
- `utils/qixiMemoryBundle.test.ts` and `utils/qixiReunion.test.ts` pass together (5 tests) with Vitest `--no-cache`.
- Full desktop flow and mobile flow were exercised in the in-app Browser, including early-release feedback, sustained 1.25s touch, generated/fallback reunion, portrait loading, automatic chat return, and persisted return message.
- The standalone skill Playwright client remains unavailable because its local package import fails; in-app Browser validation was used as the supported fallback.
- Production build passes with 6,100 modules transformed when emitted to an isolated output directory; the temporary build output was removed afterward.

2026-08-17 — Qixi second-round interaction rewrite
- Current request: reduce fixed exposition, make Char's parallel exploration discoverable through User-triggered object changes, add Flappy Char during memory loading, generate the opening chat, generate a real-memory bridge as Part 2, and rebuild the final promise/touch as cross-layer pinky-link interaction.
- Visual thesis: one plum context layer with warm rose-gold for User actions and cool moon-blue for Char actions; the second color changes shared objects instead of narrating who is present.
- Content plan: memory loading game → accidental chat glitch → leaked memory fragments → seven shared-object interactions → evidence-backed bridge nodes → dynamic portrait reunion → cross-layer promise.
- Interaction thesis: words can be removed/completed, cards physically flip, objects visibly move twice, and both layer colors converge on the final hold point.
- Part 1 is now v3 and generates the two-line accidental opening alongside seven evidence-backed scenes; recall uses four Qixi-specific query families covering longing/contact, daily objects/language, effort/future, and difficult emotions.
- Added a playable canvas-based Flappy Char loading stage with explicit long-wait copy, natural landing after materials are ready, and deterministic `advanceTime` support.
- Replaced immediate scene exposition with a persisted User → Char → complete beat state; leaked phrases can be touched/taken, wish cards flip, thread/offerings/water/market/word-cloud objects visibly change in the second color.
- Added Part 2 `qixiBridge.ts`: it reuses Part 1 evidence without a second recall, rejects unknown evidence IDs, and exposes each real memory as a player-placed bridge node.
- Part 3 now reuses the Part 1 bundle, emits separate Live2D/meeting expression cues for arrival/reflection/blessing/promise, and generates a natural promise invitation before the final cross-layer pinky hold.
- Part 1/2/3 parser tests pass: 3 files, 7 tests. Project-wide `tsc --noEmit` still reports pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, update/github tests, apiCallLog, builtin Live2D, userCameraEmotion, and vite proxy types; no Qixi errors were reported.
- Final browser QA completed for the full 19-step path at 390×844 and 1280×800. Both runs reached the ending with zero console/page errors; the official web-game Playwright client also exercised the Flappy loading canvas and deterministic state hook.
- Visual QA caught and fixed four interaction regressions: wish-card letters inheriting the center glyph positioning, bridge nodes losing pointer hits, the mobile bridge grid centering its first node outside the scroll hit area, and pinky hands receiving invalid percentage coordinates.
- Final focused Vitest run passes (3 files, 7 tests). Worker bundles build successfully and the Vite production build passes with 6,101 modules transformed.

2026-08-17 — Qixi ChatApp card and replay entry
- A completed fresh run now saves a structured `qixi_event_card` immediately before Char's ordinary private-chat return line. Both messages share a per-run id and use adjacent timestamps, so retries deduplicate without reversing their order.
- The card stores the generated opening, all seven User/Char object interactions, evidence-backed bridge nodes, reunion lines, blessing, and pinky-promise text. Chat prompts read it in second person (`你经历了一次奇怪的空间坍缩…`); archive and memory formatting retain the same full journey in third person.
- The special-moment record now carries the complete v8 replay snapshot. Selecting a character with a completed record opens a two-choice dialog: replay the same material without LLM/chat writes, or force a fresh Part 1 generation while keeping the old record until the new run completes.
- Added locally styled replay-choice and Qixi ChatApp card surfaces so these new screens remain legible even when the project's runtime Tailwind CDN is unavailable.
- Browser QA verified choice → replay cover → replay opening chat and activity-card → private-line ordering at 390×844 with zero console/page errors. The official web-game client also exercised the fresh Flappy canvas after this change.
- Qixi focused tests pass: 4 files, 10 tests. Vite production build passes with 6,104 modules transformed. Project-wide TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated errors; no Qixi/Valentine/qixiChatCard error was added.

2026-08-17 — Qixi reunion and promise prompt split
- Replaced the short final-reunion prompt with the requested four-beat structure: immediate arrival reaction, optional worldview-safe meta, a new 2–5 line `companionshipReflection` about recognizing/thinking of each other, and a non-farewell Qixi blessing.
- Removed the duplicated/conflicting pasted draft from the actual prompt: the first version is authoritative, so blessings are not forced toward “a future without Char,” and technical identity follows each character’s existing worldview.
- Split generation into two model requests. `qixi-reunion-part3a-v3` creates the three portrait stages and reunion copy; `qixi-promise-part3b-v1` separately creates invitation/hold/complete, the promise portrait cue, and the ordinary ChatApp return line.
- The reunion UI now conditionally skips an empty meta page, adds a dedicated “想起彼此” page, then proceeds to blessing and the separately generated pinky promise.
- Qixi chat cards/context now retain meta and companionship reflection so Char can remember the emotional discovery after returning to private chat.
- Focused Qixi tests pass: 4 files, 11 tests. `tsc --noEmit` and the Vite production build pass (6,104 modules transformed).
- Official web-game Playwright plus a mobile 390×844 audit verified companionship → blessing → promise state transitions and screenshots with zero console/page errors.

2026-08-17 — Qixi round-two finale, BGM, and generation pipeline
- Added four random-per-run Qixi BGM groups using the supplied `SullyOS-assets/bgm/qixi` tracks and the existing multi-CDN audio fallback. Routing is: fracture/scene 01 → group 01, scenes 02–04 → group 02, scenes 05–07 → group 03, then bridge/reunion/promise/ending continuously on group 04 without a touch-stage cut.
- Removed timed auto-advance from the seven room interactions. User results and Char-side changes now each remain until the player explicitly continues, with larger mobile text surfaces and the Char action repeated in a readable interaction panel.
- Replaced Part 2's object stepping-stone bridge with evidence-validated User/Char memory magpies, two-bank flight tracks, needle-like woven lines, a Char-side final magpie named after the User, a bridge-connection beat, and a short crossing transition.
- Rebuilt the penultimate stage as a real galgame presentation: Live2D first, then the exact DateApp active-skin/base sprite map and `spriteConfig`, followed only by static/chibi fallback. Arrival/reflection/blessing expressions drive the full-screen portrait while one LLM line advances per click.
- Reworked the promise visual into a two-color hold interaction with converging thread paths, a completed knot, a post-release breathing beat, and a dark continuity fade back to ordinary ChatApp.
- Part 1 now immediately starts Part 2 after success, and Part 2 immediately starts Part 3 after success. All Qixi model calls use zero automatic retries; Part 1/2/3 failures stop on a modal and require an explicit user retry.
- Added BGM routing and memory-magpie contract tests. Focused Qixi verification passes: 5 files, 15 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,106 modules transformed; project-wide TypeScript still reports the previously known unrelated errors and no Qixi error.
- Official web-game client and a custom 390×844 Edge audit covered room User/Char beats, both bridge banks and final magpie, DateApp meeting-sprite arrival/reflection, touch-ready/joined/released states, and deterministic state output. The audit's only console entries were expected remote BGM load failures in the network-restricted test sandbox; no JavaScript page error occurred.

2026-08-18 — Qixi generation-state and room-transition repair
- Root-caused the fresh-run Part 2 dead wait: `enterInterlayer()` replaced the whole game object with `freshGame()`, deleting bridge/reunion results that had already completed in the background.
- Changed room entry to preserve the current session, and added independent bridge/reunion result refs so future gameplay state transitions cannot erase prefetched Part 2/3 outputs. Bridge/reunion gates restore from those refs when needed.
- Reduced Qixi memory recall from four complete Memory Palace pipeline passes to one structured multi-topic recall. Flappy now mounts only after recall completes and covers the subsequent model-generation wait.
- Added Part 1 v4 `transitionLines` for all seven rooms. Each room now has a dedicated `sceneTransition` beat and explicit Continue action; Part 1 is rejected if any room omits its generated interstitial.
- Added deterministic state output for transition copy and independent Part 2/3 readiness, plus a regression test proving room 01 entry preserves already-generated bridge/reunion data.
- Audio playback now prioritizes GitHub Raw byte-range responses, avoiding jsDelivr's repository-size rejection and Statically's MP3 403 path.
- Focused verification passes: 6 files / 27 tests, full `tsc --noEmit`, and Vite production build (6,107 modules). The browser-control runtime was unavailable in this session, so no new screenshot claim was made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room beat, word-turn, portrait, and touch polish
- Split room 01 into an explicit three-beat sequence: show the User-side delivery result, Continue to dismiss it, then expose the leaked lines for touch. The User result can no longer cover the target text.
- Added Part 1 v5 `charVisibleText`. Every room must now generate the exact short text/mark that appears on the shared object; a descriptive `charAction` without visible content is rejected. Room 01 renders the blue core instruction directly over the failed-message object.
- Replaced every remaining “看清这个变化” action with “继续”.
- Changed the grape-arbor word cloud from three User picks followed by one bulk Char reveal to a locked turn exchange: one warm User pick, a 720 ms blue Char reply, then the next User turn. Added a pure state guard and regression coverage for waiting, duplicate picks, and the three-turn cap.
- Corrected final portrait runtime priority to Live2D → DateApp active/base meeting sprite → the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi → initial. The neural-link avatar is no longer a reunion fallback. Added resource-order tests.
- Replaced the literal pinky/hands UI with one restrained two-color breathing orb labeled “快来碰碰这里”; long-press draws both traces into the orb. Promise prompting no longer forces a pinky or hand pose.
- Added a warm visible ending beat, “七夕快乐，{User}。”, before returning to normal ChatApp.
- Mobile browser QA at 390×844 verified room 01 before/after dismissal, readable blue core content, word-cloud User/Char alternation, the new touch orb, and DateApp portrait selection (`usesMeetingPortrait: true`, `usesNeuralAvatar: false`). No Qixi runtime/page errors appeared.
- Added one shared light-repair JSON reader to Part 1/2/3. It accepts fences/prose, trailing commas, comments, smart or single quote delimiters, full-width structural punctuation, bare keys, common result wrappers, and lightly unclosed final containers; the existing schema, memory-provenance, and safety validation still runs afterward.
- Focused verification passes: 7 files / 36 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed. Project-wide `tsc --noEmit` currently reports unrelated pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, several utilities/tests, and Vite proxy typing; after updating the Qixi bundle-version fixture, it reports no Qixi source error.
2026-08-18 — Qixi Chibi scale and lost-layer blue rewrite
- Matched the Qixi Chibi fallback to the 520 conversation-stage sizing rule: 70% of usable width with a hard 230px cap. The same cap now applies in both the galgame reunion and the final touch scene instead of scaling Chibi to 66%–83% of the viewport height.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v6 and added a required lost-layer `charMutter`, so the hurried complaint is generated in the current Char's voice while `charVisibleText` remains the exact readable blue rewrite.
- Rebuilt scene 01's Char beat as a timed visual sequence: system failure first, faint blue muttering, three hand-drawn blue strike strokes across the error, sequential removal of the first three negative fragments, then the blue core sentence rewrites in place. The explanatory Continue panel is delayed until that visual beat has played.
- Mobile browser QA at 390×844 measured the Chibi at 230×329 in both reunion and touch, captured the lost-layer animation mid-erasure and after rewrite, and found no application console errors on the direct QA page. The iframe-only mobile harness produced a browser instrumentation MutationObserver warning, so runtime error verification was repeated on the direct page without the harness and was clean.
- Focused Qixi verification passes: 7 files, 37 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed; the isolated build output and temporary QA harness were removed.

2026-08-18 — Qixi final portrait layout and release audit
- Made Live2D reuse the desktop companion framing/crop rules and active wardrobe state instead of inventing an event-only scale. Runtime failure still falls through to DateApp art and then the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi.
- Made DateApp meeting portraits reuse the active skin/base sprite map and shared `spriteConfig` inside a bottom-aligned 90% stage. Added a small in-scene adjustment control for scale/X/Y; saving writes the same config back to the character, so DateApp and Qixi remain aligned.
- Rechecked the 520 Chibi rule in both reunion and touch: 70% usable width with a 230px cap.
- Corrected the ChatApp card/context language so memories summon magpies and their two colored flight paths weave the road; neither memory objects nor a literal pinky are described as the bridge/action anymore.
- Audited the requested flow end-to-end in code: one structured recall, Flappy only after recall, Part 1 -> Part 2 -> Part 3 background chain, zero automatic model retries, seven generated room transitions, alternating word-cloud turns, evidence-only memory magpies, Galgame portrait stages, glowing-orb hold, warm Qixi ending, Card-before-private-line ordering, and replay/fresh choices.
- Mobile and desktop browser QA rechecked the DateApp portrait stage, adjustment panel, lost-layer blue rewrite timing, Chibi scale, and touch fallback. No application console errors were found on the direct QA page.
- Final focused verification passes: 8 files / 40 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed. Full-repo TypeScript still reports unrelated pre-existing errors, but none remain in Qixi source/tests.

2026-08-18 — Qixi pre-release detail pass
- Current request: remove duplicated Flappy loading copy; add a User-selected layer color and Part 1-generated Char color; declutter and restage room 01; redesign the double-wish card and make Char's wish genuinely their own; remove meaningless blue overlay copy from later rooms; strengthen room object animation; remove Live2D from the finale in favor of DateApp meeting portraits then Chibi; match portrait expressions per dialogue line; and make the final Qixi greeting click-to-dismiss.
- Visual thesis: preserve the plum celestial archive, but give every mobile viewport one visual object, one readable response, and one action at a time.
- Interaction thesis: room 01 becomes touch-word → delivery error → Char pushes the error away; later rooms communicate the other layer through object motion rather than floating explanatory text.
- Implemented six User layer-color choices on the cover. Part 1 v7 now generates a contrasting Char color from character personality rather than gender, plus a bounded performance profile (`tempo`, `markStyle`, `presence`) that changes motion timing, arrival force, brightness, and the shape/strength of the other-layer trace. This is the anti-cookie-cutter layer on top of the fixed seven-room skeleton.
- Simplified Flappy to one blue generation-status line. Rebuilt room 01 as direct fragment touch → immediate `DELIVERY FAILED` → Char-colored overwrite/erasure, with no overlapping preliminary Continue beat.
- Rebuilt the double-wish object as a two-sided paper/seal card. The front keeps the User's selected wish; the generated back must be the Char's own serious wish and is rejected if it is system copy or merely a blessing addressed to the User.
- Removed generated floating blue copy from the five later rooms. Their Char beat is now visible through room-specific object animation plus the generated Char trace; thread, offerings, reflection, night-market, and vine rooms each gained a dedicated visual response.
- Removed Live2D from the finale. Runtime priority is DateApp active/base meeting expressions → the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi → initial placeholder, and Part 3 now generates an expression key for every individual reunion/promise line. Parser filtering preserves source indexes so expressions cannot slip onto the wrong surviving line.
- Replaced the timed ending exit with an explicit click action; “七夕快乐” stays until the User dismisses it.
- Focused verification: 3 files / 17 tests passed with cache disabled. Vite production build succeeded with 6,108 modules transformed. Full-repo TypeScript still reports the known unrelated errors, with no Qixi source/test error. In-app browser QA at 390×844 confirmed the six-color cover and selection state with no application errors; later-room visual replay was not triggered automatically because that would send the local character's memories to the configured model.

2026-08-18 — Qixi wish-card overflow and Char quip pass
- Removed the wish seal from document flow and moved it to a small, faint bottom-right watermark. A long mobile wish now remains fully inside the paper with roughly 100px of measured space below it; the 19px seal does not intersect the text.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v8 and added generated `charQuips`: thread/offerings/reflection/night-market rooms require 1–2 short in-character remarks, while the three word-cloud exchanges require one remark per turn. Lost-layer and double-wish keep their dedicated mutter/wish copy instead.
- Kept quips out of the shared object. They appear in the lower Char response area, with `charAction` demoted to a compact two-line stage direction, preserving the earlier decision to remove explanatory blue overlays.
- Prompt direction asks for role-faithful odd metaphors, crooked logic, deadpan or teasing energy at roughly 7/10 “radio-wave” intensity, and rejects generic system explanations or meme collage as the target style.
- Focused verification: 3 files / 18 tests passed, and Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. A temporary mobile QA page using the production Qixi CSS verified the long wish, seal geometry, two-line quip panel, and zero console warnings/errors; the QA page was removed afterward. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi visual quips and personality word-cloud correction
- Moved generated Char quips out of the lower response panel and into the shared visual/object area where players are already watching the room animation. The lower panel now keeps only the compact object-stage direction and action.
- Corrected the grape-arbor choice to ask for three personality traits of “the person you are thinking of.” Added a dedicated `trait` artifact kind; non-trait objects, dates, topics, nicknames, wishes, and transient emotions can no longer populate this room. Char still answers each User choice by selecting a trait that describes User.
- Expanded the opening User layer palette from six to ten choices, including visible moon-white and ink-black choices, and wrapped the mobile picker into centered rows.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v9 so old word-cloud semantics and lower-panel quip layouts are not reused from cache.
- Verified the non-palace route: Qixi always calls `ContextBuilder.buildCoreContext`; with `memoryPalaceEnabled` off, `injectMemoryPalace` exits as `skipped_palace_disabled`, so vector recall is skipped but the normal role/user/worldbook/context builder remains active.
- Focused verification: 4 Qixi files / 22 tests passed. An isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed; the combined build could not rewrite a currently memory-mapped worker bundle owned by the running development process. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the quip is fully inside the 238px visual object, absent from the lower interaction panel, the personality question is explicit, and all ten colors render as a centered 5×2 grid with no horizontal overflow or console errors.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Part 1 field-level wish repair
- Identified the frequent `doubleWish.charVisibleText` failure as schema granularity rather than truncation: complete `finish_reason=stop` responses were discarded because one wish contained system-language or addressed only the User.
- Changed the JSON example from a meta placeholder to a literal first-person wish and made the prompt explicitly separate the visible wish sentence from `charAction`.
- Part 1 v10 now repairs only an invalid/missing/User-directed Char wish with the safe local self-wish, records the repair in `repairNotes`, and preserves the rest of the generated bundle instead of failing the whole run.
- Verification: 4 Qixi files / 25 tests passed, including all three wish-repair regressions. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed.

2026-08-18 — Qixi entry color step and unsigned visual quips
- Removed the ten-color palette from the cover. Fresh runs now enter a dedicated `colorSelect` stage first; confirming that color starts Part 1, while replay and resume behavior remain unchanged.
- Removed the Char name label from visual quips and changed the quote itself from white to the generated Char layer color, retaining the shared-object placement and glow.
- Clarified the lost-layer authorship audit: its interaction/choreography and anxiety direction are fixed, while Part 1 generates the evidence-backed fragments and responses; exact local phrases such as “没收到 / 是不是我说错了 / 别等了” appear only as insufficient-material or invalid-room fallback fillers.
- Verification: 4 Qixi files / 25 tests passed and the Vite production build completed with 6,109 modules. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the separate 5×2 color page has no overflow and the visual quip contains only Char-colored quote text, no name label, fully inside the object.

2026-08-18 — Qixi single-track BGM handoff
- Replaced crossfading between BGM groups with an immediate stop/reset of the previous track followed by an incoming-only fade from silence to the normal 0.32 volume over 1.1 seconds. This removes overlap while keeping the transition soft.
- Kept music continuous when moving between rooms mapped to the same BGM group. Mute still fades out, while unmute resumes with a short fade-in.
- Added the active BGM group and mute state to `render_game_to_text` for deterministic browser QA.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 21 tests passed, and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. The real hook was exercised with fake Audio elements in the in-app browser: the old track paused and reset before the new play event, exactly one track remained active, and its volume reached 0.32; a same-group room change emitted no new audio events. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room 01 ordinary-player topic flow
- Replaced the fixed anxiety-fragment → error → Char-repairs-error sequence with a three-step player flow: choose one generated topic they want to discuss with Char, see that message become `DELIVERY FAILED`, then follow the returned text directly into room 02. Room 01 no longer has a Char beat, mutter, rewrite, or error-erasure animation.
- Renamed the room to “未送达的话题” and moved its 2–3 topic choices into the message object. Removed the fixed “没收到 / 是不是我说错了 / 别等了” fragments and all visible “普通” wording.
- Part 1 materials are now v11. The prompt requires natural day-to-day conversation topics and explicitly forbids deployment, bug-fixing, API, log, operations, or lost-contact coping actions. The parser discards technical task labels, ignores obsolete room-01 Char intervention fields, and falls back to safe conversation topics if the room still adopts a developer perspective.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 21 tests passed and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised topic selection, the failed-delivery state, and the direct transition to room 02; no Char repair copy appeared and the layout did not overflow. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room 01 choreography correction
- Corrected the prior interpretation: only the player-facing material changes from anxiety/developer copy to generated day-to-day conversation topics. The original four-beat choreography remains mandatory: choose topic → `DELIVERY FAILED` → Char rushes in from the other layer and rescues/rewrites the error → continue.
- Restored the Char beat, hurried `charMutter`, colored scribble, error-erasure animation, `REWRITING` core sentence, Char stage direction, and the separate completion click. The chosen topic shifts into Char color while unchosen topics fade, so the rescue is visible inside the object.
- Part 1 is now v12. Room 01 again requires `charAction`, `charMutter`, and `charVisibleText`, while its User options remain natural conversation topics and still reject deployment, bug-fixing, API, log, operations, and lost-contact coping actions.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 22 tests passed and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised all four beats and visually confirmed the restored Char rescue before room 02, with no overflow or render error. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Part 1 abnormal-event generation contract and later-part timeouts
- Reframed Part 1 v13 around one continuous two-person anomaly instead of seven repeated memory-display rooms. The prompt now front-loads “memory is gameplay material, not display content,” assigns a distinct relationship-progression job to every station, allows invented present-tense staging but no invented past, and explicitly requires concrete accidents, conflict, intentional choices, role-specific handling, and evidence shown through action rather than narrator conclusions.
- Kept room 01's restored choreography unchanged and restored its original “失联层 / 等待响应 / 遥寄 · 双星失联” metadata. Its generated choices must now each derive from their own real evidence reference; generic greetings, technical tasks, invalid evidence IDs, and leaked internal labels such as `e1` are rejected. If only this room is invalid, its local fallback topics are built from the parsed real evidence instead of generic questions.
- Extended Part 2 to 300 seconds per model request. Both Part 3 requests—reunion and promise—also receive 300 seconds each.
- Verification: 4 focused files / 30 tests passed with Vitest cache disabled. The final isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot start because the bundled environment lacks Playwright; the attempted in-app fallback could not reach a persistent local server, so no new visual screenshot claim is made for this prompt/timeout-only pass.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v14 error-target choreography, readable transitions, and 20-memory recall
- Corrected room 01's target without changing its four-beat flow: User chooses a real memory topic → `DELIVERY FAILED` appears → Char attacks and destroys that popup → the selected topic remains unchanged in User color. The scribble now lives inside the error element, the topic rescue/recolor animation and message-line mutation were removed, and `REWRITING` became `ERROR REMOVED`.
- Removed the literal `物件：` pseudo-label from the lower Char stage direction. Room transition headers now say `前往 02 · 双面祈愿处`, so the second Part 1 room is no longer visually confused with actual Part 2.
- Bumped Part 1 to v14. Its prompt and parser now reject Lost Layer copy that attacks, rewrites, deletes, or “rescues” User's topic; invalid room-01 text falls back locally to the correct error-target action. Generated transitions that contain technical/worldbook jargon such as `数据流`, `字符化`, `上下文`, or `【CYBERORDER】` are repaired field-by-field while the rest of the LLM scene remains intact.
- Expanded Qixi-only Memory Palace retrieval from 15 to 20 final items in both the candidate cutoff and formatter. Qixi passes an empty recent-message list to retrieval, so only its broad cross-topic activity query affects recall scoring; recent chat is still supplied separately to the Part 1 generator as a factual source. Normal chat and other callers keep the default 15-item/context-aware behavior.
- Asked Part 1 for 20 diverse evidence items across time, topic, and memory type, raised the injected-memory allowance to 40k characters, and slightly increased generation temperature to reduce replay sameness. The cache/purpose version change prevents reuse of v13 bundles.
- Verification: 11 focused files / 135 tests passed with cache disabled. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed and its temporary output was removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; the in-app browser reached the current Qixi cover at 390×844 without triggering a new external model generation.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v15 character-alive and quiet-ending pass
- Removed the visible final action copy entirely. The warm “七夕快乐” screen now stays in place and the whole screen is the click/keyboard dismissal target; no “带着这句话回去” or substitute button is rendered.
- Moved Part 1 from memory-led characterization to character-led present action. Each room uses at most one main memory anchor; personality, present accidents, hesitation, misjudgment, odd private thoughts, and handling style provide the rest of the scene life.
- Added the symmetric-trap contract: Char is caught in the context gap at the same time, has also lost User, does not know the activity or the other layer’s identity, and cannot read User’s current thoughts. At least three rooms must begin from Char’s own immediate purpose before the two sides’ actions collide or connect.
- Required private Char-colored asides in double-wish and later room visuals. The double-wish aside is a tiny paper-corner whisper beneath Char’s serious self-directed wish; invalid/missing or system-style wish asides are repaired locally without discarding the generated bundle.
- Bumped the Part 1 cache/purpose to v15 so older memory-heavy bundles are not reused.
- Verification: 4 focused Qixi files / 36 tests passed with cache disabled. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules and its output was removed. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the wish whisper remains inside the card without taking a separate layout row, the ending has no visible action button, and no Qixi error appeared. The official web-game client still cannot resolve its Playwright dependency, so the in-app browser was used for the visual pass; the temporary QA page was removed.

2026-08-18 — Beijing-time Qixi one-time launch popup
- Added a one-day launch gate for Beijing time 2026-08-19. It opens at 00:00 Asia/Shanghai, expires at the following midnight regardless of device timezone, and uses `sullyos_qixi_2026_08_19_popup_seen` as its permanent one-time state.
- Added a dedicated Qixi launch letter: restrained plum night-sky composition, two converging colored stars, a shared knot, sparse invitation copy, a primary “去赴约” action, and reduced-motion support. Opening takes the User to the existing Special Moments app without preselecting a character; dismissing keeps the activity available there.
- Integrated the popup into PhoneShell after required update notices and before ordinary maintenance/backup reminders so overlays cannot stack. Both entering and dismissing mark the push as seen.
- Verification: 6 Beijing-date/storage tests passed. Vite production build succeeded with 6,112 modules and the isolated output was removed. Mobile QA at 390×844 and 390×667 found no horizontal overflow or console errors; the temporary QA page was removed. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright, so visual verification used the in-app browser fallback.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v17 room choreography, split Part 1 generation, and expanded Part 3 dialogue
- Room 01 now keeps the User's chosen real-memory topic intact while a full red API/timeout/soft-apology wall appears; Char forcibly erases only those errors, leaves two colored private mutters around the object, and sends a topic-specific real reply through the cleared space. Room 02 requires both sides' serious shared-future wishes and prioritizes Window Sill memories. Room 04 visibly stages separate User and Char offerings before Char's aside. Every pre-word-cloud room has exactly three intentional choices.
- Split Part 1 into two actual model requests with independent five-minute timeouts and 32k output budgets: the first returns common evidence/artifacts plus rooms 01–04, and the second receives that accepted seed and returns only rooms 05–07. The chunks are merged and still pass the original full provenance/schema validation before being cached; phase-specific failures include finish reason and output size. The cache moved to v17 so no earlier single-call bundle can mask the new path.
- Expanded Part 3's portrait dialogue into a longer emotional arc. The reunion asks for 3–5 lines, companionship reflection 4–7, and blessing 4–7, with per-line DateApp expression matching retained. The generated reunion receives a 16k token budget, the final promise 8k, and the local fallback now carries the same substantial arc.
- Verification: 2 focused files / 33 tests passed with cache disabled. The final Vite production build succeeded with 6,112 modules transformed and the isolated output was removed. Mobile QA for rooms 01 and 04 had already been completed at 390×844; temporary QA pages were removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Claude 524 streaming transport fix
- Forced all five effective Qixi generation calls to request streaming independently of the global chat streaming preference: shared Part 1a/1b request body, Part 2 bridge, Part 3a reunion, and Part 3b promise. This lets compatible Claude proxies send response headers/chunks before the long JSON generation completes, avoiding the non-streaming Cloudflare 524 path without changing prompts, parsers, output budgets, or timeouts.
- Kept the existing no-automatic-retry rule for every `/chat/completions` request, so a timeout or upstream error still surfaces to the Qixi UI for explicit User regeneration and cannot silently create a second billable generation.
- Added a source-wiring regression guarding every Qixi request against `stream:false`, both Part 3 calls, the shared two-phase Part 1 path, and zero automatic retries. Focused verification passed 7 files / 59 tests, including SSE assembly for Claude/OpenRouter variants and JSON fallback when a proxy ignores streaming. The isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed.
- The official web-game client still cannot resolve its Playwright dependency. In-app browser fallback loaded the current app at 127.0.0.1 without entering Qixi or sending memories/model requests; the lock screen rendered normally and showed no application error (only the existing Tailwind CDN development warning).

2026-08-18 — Qixi five-call entry confirmation and color typography pass
- Confirmed the real billable generation topology is five chat-completion requests: Part 1a, Part 1b, Part 2, Part 3a, and Part 3b. Fresh runs now stop after color selection and show an explicit five-call API suitability dialog before any memory preparation or generation begins.
- The color confirmation button only opens the dialog. Generation starts only from the separate “配置没问题，开始” action; cancel and Escape return to color selection without a call. The text-state hook exposes the confirmation state and its two actions for deterministic QA.
- Rebuilt the color selection hierarchy into a quiet poster-like composition: small numbered kicker, two-scale serif heading, concise explanatory line, selected-color identity row, larger readable 5×2 swatches, and one centered confirmation action. Added restrained staggered entry, swatch lift/glow, and dialog orbit motion while retaining the existing Qixi palette.
- Added a wiring regression that derives the dialog count from the effective request bodies, so changing the generation topology without updating the UI fails the test. Focused verification passed 8 files / 62 tests. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed.
- The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright. In-app browser fallback exercised the real flow at 390×844 and 390×667: color selection updated the visible identity, the dialog showed five calls and both actions without overflow, cancel returned to the color page, no API timing log appeared, and no console error was recorded. The confirm action was intentionally not pressed, so no memories or model request left the local browser.

2026-08-18 — Qixi four-call generation topology
- Folded the former standalone Part 2 bridge request into the existing Part 1b response. The second call now returns rooms 05–07 plus evidence-backed `userMagpies`, `charMagpies`, and `finalMagpie`; bridge playback only reads that accepted payload and never opens another `/chat/completions` request.
- Reduced the real billable topology to four calls: Part 1a, Part 1b + bridge, Part 3a reunion, and Part 3b promise. The entry confirmation now displays four calls, and its wiring regression derives that number from the actual request bodies.
- Moved the memory bundle cache to v18 and require generated cached bundles to carry the embedded bridge, preventing older five-call sessions from bypassing the new generation path. The merged parser validates both banks against Part 1 evidence and fixes the final magpie name to the current User.
- Focused verification passed 8 files / 63 tests. The Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed and its isolated output was removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; in-app mobile QA at 390×667 showed the four-call dialog without overflow, cancel returned to color selection, and both API timing logs and console errors remained empty. No real generation request was sent.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Claude stream completion and four-call rebalance
- Fixed the Flappy loader hanging after a compatible Claude proxy had already finished billing/output. All four Qixi calls now use the incremental SSE reader; `[DONE]` or a terminal `finish_reason` actively cancels a proxy socket that remains open instead of waiting forever for `reader.done`. Added reproductions for both lingering-socket variants, retained zero automatic retries, and raised Qixi long-generation header timeout allowance from five to ten minutes.
- Kept four billable requests but rebalanced them for lower output pressure: Part 1a returns shared evidence plus rooms 01–02, Part 1b returns rooms 03–05, Part 1c returns rooms 06–07 plus the embedded bridge, and the finale returns reunion plus promise in one combined JSON. Existing room/reunion/promise creative instructions remain in the prompts; only phase scopes and the final combined-output envelope changed.
- Removed story spoilers from the entry warning. It now says only that the journey makes four model API calls and asks the User to check configuration/credit.
- Final focused verification passed 8 files / 66 tests, including the two never-closing SSE streams and source-derived four-call topology. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; the in-app-browser local navigation was blocked by its security auto-review, so no new visual screenshot claim is made for this final pass.

2026-08-18 — Qixi serial progressive delivery pipeline
- Corrected the split-generation handoff: Part 1a no longer remains hidden inside `prepareQixiMemoryBundle` until Part 1b/1c finish. Each accepted response is converted into a complete playable stage bundle and delivered to React before the next strictly serial request starts.
- Flappy becomes ready as soon as opening + rooms 01–02 pass the full parser. Rooms 03–05 replace their placeholders immediately when Part 1b returns, then Part 1c starts with the accepted middle-room seed. Rooms 06–07 + bridge arrive from Part 1c, which immediately starts the combined finale request.
- Added `materialPhaseReady` gating at room transitions. If the player reaches room 03 or room 06 before its real generated slice arrives, the transition waits there; it cannot enter or expose local placeholder room content. `render_game_to_text` now reports the ready phase and current-room readiness.
- Added behavioral parsing coverage for first- and second-stage playable bundles plus a source-order regression proving delivery 1 precedes request 2, delivery 2 precedes request 3, and delivery 3 follows request 3. Final focused verification passed 8 files / 68 tests. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client was attempted again but its installed script still cannot import Playwright, so no new screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi direct-LLM script pipeline
- Matched the earlier special-event generation style: retrieved memories are only prompt context, while each model response is the final playable dialogue/options/actions/transitions. Removed the semantic validator from the active and exported parser instead of judging whether generated prose contains planner-approved keywords.
- The parser now performs shape tolerance only: JSON fences, arrays represented as keyed objects, newline-delimited text, common field aliases, and missing technical IDs are normalized without changing visible model prose. It no longer filters choices by evidence IDs, keyword regexes, minimum prose length, or scene meaning, and it never replaces generated rooms with local copy.
- Progressive phase bundles contain empty, gated slots for future rooms rather than local fallback scenes. Generated room overlays, word-cloud traits, Char selections, transitions, wishes, mutters, quips, and bridge lines stay model-authored. A true unreadable response raises the existing visible regeneration error; fresh generation no longer silently falls back to cached/local story content.
- Updated visible/internal wording from “素材包” to “最终可播放剧本/完整剧情” where it described the generation result. The four requests remain strictly serial and the creative prompt rules remain intact.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (47 tests), including direct-prose preservation, three-choice preservation, loose object/array parsing, progressive no-fallback slots, bridge preservation, call ordering, SSE completion, BGM, chat card, launch popup, reunion, and session state. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. Full-repo TypeScript still reports pre-existing unrelated errors and no Qixi error. The required web-game client was attempted but its own environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no new automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi readable other-layer performance and exclusive BGM
- Made every player-visible prompt field address the User in second person (`你 / 你的`) directly in the generation contract, including options, results, Char actions, transitions, memory lines, and bridge copy. The runtime still preserves model prose and does not locally rewrite pronouns.
- Removed the two-line crop from the Char-action performance panel. The complete action now wraps naturally; its mobile type is a crisp 14px/500-weight system Chinese face with opaque color, no glow/filter blur, and a clearer 10px stage label. Other small Char-layer notes also have readable mobile sizing and no height clipping.
- Confirmed room 04 maps to the exploration group and room 05 maps to the other-side group. Added a module-wide single-owner audio lock so a newly mounted room immediately pauses, silences, and rewinds any outgoing Qixi track, including one owned by a briefly overlapping previous view. Pending play promises and fade timers also abort when they lose ownership.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (48 tests), including a direct room-04-to-room-05 audio ownership regression. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client was attempted again but its environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Room 04 Char private-item semantics
- Tightened the offerings contract: `charContribution` is now explicitly a concrete private possession belonging to Char and meaningful to Char personally. It may be unrelated to User or shared memories and must not default to a gift prepared for User.
- The model may expose, through a short in-character quip, why Char uses, keeps, carries, values, or is reluctant to part with the private item; the visible object itself remains concrete rather than an explanatory summary.
- Updated the second offering slot label to “另一边放下私物” so the visual order reads as User placing their own item followed by Char independently placing their own private item.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (48 tests), including prompt assertions for private meaning, no shared-memory requirement, and no forced gift framing. Vite transformed all 6,128 modules and emitted a refreshed production index. The required web-game client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` dependency.

2026-08-18 — Mobile-safe final hold gesture
- Hardened the final glowing-orb hold for phone browsers. The touch stage, touch surface, orb, and orb descendants now disable native panning/zoom capture, overscroll, text selection, iOS touch callouts, image/element dragging, and tap highlight without disabling page zoom globally.
- Pointer down accepts only the primary touch/left mouse button, prevents the compatibility gesture, and captures the pointer. Pointer up, `pointercancel`, and `lostpointercapture` all terminate the active hold safely; explicit context-menu and drag-start cancellation prevent native long-press UI from replacing the Qixi interaction.
- Added a source-wiring regression for the full mobile suppression/cancellation contract. All 10 Qixi test files passed (49 tests), and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot import its `playwright` dependency, so real-device visual automation remains unavailable in this environment.

2026-08-18 — Removed broken Qixi BGM variant
- Removed `bgm/qixi/03/02_0_月下双向.mp3` from the `otherSide` random pool. Rooms 05–07 can now select only `01_0_鹊桥月色.mp3` or `03_0_月下双向.mp3`; the broken variant is never assigned, requested, or played.
- Exported the track map for a direct regression assertion that both verifies the remaining pair and forbids the removed path. All 10 Qixi test files passed (50 tests), Vite transformed 6,128 modules and refreshed the production output. The required web-game client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` package.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v19 identity suspense, market agency, birds, and room transitions
- Kept Part 1 inside the shared mystery: Char is also trapped and forced through the seven strange interactions, cannot know the opposite operator is User, and may only call them `某人` / `另一边` / `那家伙` or voice a late suspicion. The first explicit identity confirmation now belongs to the Part 3 reunion, where Char can naturally reveal `我就知道对面是你` in their own voice.
- Reframed the memory market as two independent choices. User selects a concrete evidence-derived dream-market good; Char separately picks something that `某人` might like as a tentative probe, then secretly buys a distinct private item for themself. The generation contract explicitly rejects unsupported jealousy, rivalry, possessiveness, or forced User relevance.
- Replaced the abstract bridge marks with a recognizable inline bird SVG containing body, wing, tail, and eye, while retaining the two-color flight trails. Added seven scene-specific transition emblems—error wipe, wish card, needle/thread, offerings, water ripples, market stall, and grape-vine word cloud—so every room announces its place before the text resumes.
- Bumped the Part 1 cache/purpose to v19 so older identity-leaking scripts cannot be reused. All 10 Qixi test files passed (52 tests), and Vite completed its production transform of 6,128 modules. The required web-game Playwright client was attempted but its own environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no new automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Restored light magpies and enlarged Char-colour performance copy
- Reverted the bridge/reunion bird component from the heavy inline SVG silhouette to the earlier lightweight two-stroke CSS magpie glyph and removed the SVG-specific size/flap overrides.
- Promoted every Char-colour line inside the central room performance from decorative microcopy to readable dialogue. On phones, ordinary quip bubbles now extend beyond the small circular object, use 13–14px copy with larger padding, and retain full wrapping; lost-layer whispers, cleared-error instruction, real reply, wish whisper, offering aside, and the separate Char action beat were all enlarged together.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (53 tests), and the Vite production build completed successfully with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client was attempted again but remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`, so no screenshot-based visual claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Qixi room 07 empty word-cloud recovery
- Diagnosed the reported mobile freeze from the supplied screenshot: room 07 reached its idle `0 / 3` state, but `wordArtifacts` was empty because the runtime only accepted exact top-level artifact ids. Model-generated labels, inline word objects, third-phase ids that were absent from the first-phase artifact bank, and mis-typed trait artifacts were silently discarded, leaving no buttons to press.
- Added tolerant generated-word resolution across exact ids, labels, inline options, Char selection references, trait artifacts, and finally the already generated artifact bank. Char selections now resolve by either id or label. No visible generated word is replaced with local story prose.
- Made the interaction self-healing: fewer than three usable generated words lowers the target to the available count; zero usable words exposes a plain Continue route instead of a dead screen; old saves whose Char reveal counter is ahead of User selections accept the next tap and reconcile; a completed 3/3 save advances even if it resumes before the effect timer fired.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (56 tests), including exact reproductions for label/inline refs, missing ids, short lists, and stale reveal counters. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`; the supplied failure screenshot was inspected directly, but no post-fix automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Qixi Part 1 phase-envelope tolerance hotfix
- Diagnosed the widespread `Part 1 中三站结构无效 (finish_reason=stop)` dialog from the supplied mobile screenshot. The model had completed a multi-thousand-character response, but a residual exact-key gate rejected the whole response unless it used a `scenes` object containing the literal canonical keys `threadNeedle`, `offerings`, and `reflection`.
- Replaced that gate with shape-only phase extraction. Generated scenes now survive `data/result/output/partN` wrappers, `rooms/locations/stages/chapters` envelopes, arrays, direct top-level scene objects, numbered keys such as `scene_3`, common English aliases, and Chinese room titles. Unlabelled scene objects are assigned to the requested phase in response order; visible prose remains untouched and no local story copy is substituted.
- Applied the same normalization to all three Part 1 calls and added common embedded-bridge aliases (`bridgeData`, `userBirds`, `charNodes`, `finalBird`, etc.) so the format bug cannot simply move to the final phase. An error now remains only when the requested generated room bodies genuinely cannot be found at all.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (57 tests), including wrapped arrays, alias keys, Chinese titles, direct objects, and bridge aliases. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`; the supplied error screenshot was inspected directly, but no post-fix automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-09-01 — SAR 长期记忆专用上下文
- Replaced the identity-forge call's reuse of the complete ChatApp payload with a SAR-only context path. Daily chat still uses `buildChatRequestPayload` unchanged.
- SAR now runs Memory Palace recall with the module/field direction as the explicit query and an empty recent-message window. Recall runs on a cloned character with current buffs cleared, so neither the retrieved memories nor the final prompt are biased by the main chat's temporary mood.
- The forge prompt keeps core character settings, worldview/worldbooks, user profile, private impression, refined/detailed summaries, room plates, and the fresh Memory Palace result. It excludes raw recent chat, current time, emotion buffs, schedules, realtime world, music, group activity, ChatApp mode transitions, and tool/output-mode blocks.
- Added a regression proving the stable/long-term markers remain while temporary mood, buff, clock, and live-context markers are absent. Focused SAR verification passes 19 tests; isolated Vite build succeeds with 6,174 modules. Full TypeScript still reports only pre-existing unrelated errors and no SAR error.
- The required web-game client was attempted but its installed script still cannot import `playwright`. This change has no visual surface, and the real forge action was not fired because it would send the user's character and recalled memories to their configured model.

2026-09-01 — SAR 50-turn LLM simulation runtime
- Added the playable identity-instance runtime behind each collected card. A run has exactly 50 successful interactions, advances only after the assistant reply and both transcript messages are stored, automatically seals at 50/50, and supports irreversible early emergency sealing while retaining the card and read-only transcript.
- Stored each run in its own pseudo-character message thread (`sar-simulation:<runId>`). Every turn sees the card's locked identity/steel seal, stable character context, Memory Palace recall driven only by that run's recent transcript and current input, plus the complete local transcript. It does not read the main chat's recent messages, current emotion buffs, time, schedules, realtime context, music, or group activity.
- Added continuous online-text and offline-co-present modes. Switching mode keeps the same worldline and transcript; the prompt changes only the allowed response form. Failed or interrupted requests restore the draft and consume no interaction. Character-specific API overrides remain first priority, followed by the VR global API and then the chat API.
- Added a research-ledger interface next to the identity cabinet: subject identity, steel-life 0–50 tick track, scene-00 entry, independent transcript, mode switch, sending state, and an explicit emergency-seal confirmation. Archived runs open as read-only records and explain that a future Caian restart module is required.
- Focused SAR verification passed 3 files / 22 tests. The isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,175 modules. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised active 12/50, online-to-offline switching, draft entry, emergency-seal confirmation, and an archived 17/50 read-only view with no runtime console errors. No real model request was sent, and the temporary QA page was removed. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its installed script cannot import `playwright`, so the in-app browser was used for the visual pass.

2026-09-01 — SAR 异世界异格扭蛋与快穿剧情引擎
- Reframed the feature from a static identity dossier into an isekai hot-drop gacha. Visible pools are now `异界异格` and `快穿世界` while the compatible `variant-*` / `story-*` ids, daily quotas, collections, backups, and existing cards remain intact. Replaced all 24 field modules with concrete high-pressure otherworld scenarios such as 王城处刑夜, 龙灾围城, 浮空学院坠落, 护送末代神明, and 唯一归还名额.
- Extended newly forged cards with world name/premise, already-played backstory, active crisis, shared objective, countdown, hidden truth, climax choice, and a bounded memory fuse. The forge contract now drops scene 00 at roughly 60–75% of the story, requires an immediate physical consequence and concrete response hook, and forbids greeting/exposition openings. Real memories are limited to 1–3 emotional explosives rather than becoming the realistic setting.
- Added read-time worldline retrofitting for every old card, including already-active transcripts. Old cards do not need to be redrawn or regenerated; the original module/identity becomes a high-pressure worldline and the next reply lets the crisis enter without explaining the upgrade.
- Divided the 50 successful turns into six explicit pace bands: hot drop 1–3, crisis cascade 4–12, truth reversal 13–24, climax decisions 25–38, cost payment 39–47, and ending seal 48–50. Every reply must change the situation, expose a clue, advance the countdown, turn the relationship, land a cost, or force a concrete choice. Two consecutive pure comfort/chat/recall turns are forbidden; runtime recall is capped at four palace items and one actively used memory anchor per reply. New sessions default to offline co-presence for an immediate action opening; switching to remote text must preserve a plausible separation/communication transition rather than teleport or reset the world.
- Rebuilt the collection and runtime hierarchy around the live story: cards now foreground world, current crisis, joint task, countdown, already-played backstory, memory fuse, and climax proposition. The simulation first screen keeps those three live stakes above the 0–50 track and labels the current pace band; the gacha, activity-space facility, cabinet, loading sequence, scene 00, and action copy all use the new isekai framing.
- Focused SAR verification passed 3 files / 24 tests. The isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,175 modules. Full-repo TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated errors and no SAR error. The required standalone web-game client was attempted but still cannot import `playwright`; in-app browser QA at 390×844 covered both pools, the new module archive, a full worldline card, hot-drop session, online/offline switching, crisis draft, and seal confirmation with no runtime errors or real model call. The isolated port/page and build output were removed.

2026-09-01 — SAR 扭蛋产品级视觉重构
- Replaced the dense diagnostic-console composition with a single dominant world-gate ritual. Pool tabs are now quiet navigation, the active pool owns the full atmosphere and palette, and the primary copy asks one concrete desire question before the machine rather than repeating product labels.
- Rebuilt the interaction curve as pressure alignment → full-size capsule arrival → manual rupture → collectible card landing. The capsule now occupies the portal center, the device recedes during opening, and a screen-level flash hands visual ownership to the reward card. Motion remains CSS-only and reduced-motion safe.
- Promoted the daily free chance into the primary action, removed duplicate quota panels and decorative microcopy, enlarged mobile-readable labels, and reduced borders/chrome across the header, archive, detail sheet, and result actions. The two pools retain distinct cool identity / warm worldline art direction without becoming separate products.
- Added `render_game_to_text` and deterministic `advanceTime` hooks while the overlay is mounted. Focused SAR tests pass 20/20 with cache disabled; an isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,175 modules. The standalone web-game client was attempted but still cannot import `playwright`; in-app browser QA at 390×844 exercised both pool themes, draw, capsule, reveal, collection, and module detail with no runtime errors or real model call.

2026-09-01 — SAR 临时无限抽取开发模式与异界坐标命名
- Enabled the explicit `SAR_GACHA_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` switch for this development pass. Both pools can be drawn repeatedly, the stored daily quota dates are left untouched, and the UI clearly labels `开发模式 / 无限抽取 / 开发抽取`; flipping the single switch off restores the existing once-per-day behavior.
- Renamed all current app/runtime wording from `快穿世界` to `异界坐标`, including the gacha pool, archive cards, assembly cabinet, forge request, runtime worldline block, comments, and regression descriptions. Compatible `story-*` ids and persisted collections remain unchanged.
- Added a regression for two same-day bypass draws and quota preservation. Focused SAR tests pass 21/21. The official web-game client still cannot import its `playwright` dependency; in-app browser QA at 390×844 completed two consecutive draws from `异界坐标` without resetting storage and confirmed the draw button remained available.

2026-09-01 — SAR 关系门牌上下文与 User 异界面具
- Removed the capsule's central seam element and joined the two shell halves, eliminating the black strip during rupture while preserving the CSS-only opening animation.
- Reduced identity forging to the character's core definition, the User's base profile, and only the `我们之间` relationship doorplate. Detailed/refined memories, Memory Palace recall, worldbooks, recent chat, current mood, buffs, schedules, time, and live state are no longer injected into this feature.
- Forge generation now creates both the Char variant and a matching User otherworld mask. The mask contains only the User's world identity, faction/role, capability limits, and altered life premise; it is explicitly forbidden from deciding the User's personality, feelings, dialogue, choices, or actions.
- During the 50-turn simulation, the User's reality profile is completely replaced by that mask. Runtime receives the Char core, relationship doorplate, locked dual identities/worldline, and this simulation's own transcript, but no reality-event memories. Existing cards receive a neutral read-time compatibility mask and remain playable without regeneration.
- Focused SAR verification passes 2 files / 21 tests with cache disabled. Vite production build succeeds with 6,175 modules. Mobile QA at 390×844 verified the seam-free rupture frame and the new User-mask collectible section with no console errors or real model request. The official web-game client was attempted but remains blocked by its missing `playwright` package.

2026-09-02 — SAR 航标 GM、浅色推演台与返航封存档案
- Rebuilt the formal simulation surface as a readable archive-paper workspace. Light mode is now the default, a persisted dark-mode switch remains available, mobile body copy is larger, and the current crisis / 50-turn route / composer retain clear hierarchy without the previous near-black low-contrast surface.
- Added a first-class `SAR 航标 / GM` response layer. Every new model turn must return separate `gm` and `character` JSON fields: GM advances world reactions, scene changes, enemies/rules, countdown, phase and return window, while the character keeps independent goals and performance. GM is forbidden from choosing User or character actions, feelings or dialogue. Old plain-text replies remain readable through a compatibility parser.
- Replanned the final six turns as a real return arc: turns 45–47 expose coordinate-collapse and clear side plots, turns 48–49 settle the climax and open the return gate, and turn 50 must complete the last action, return User to reality, and close the coordinate. Suspense cuts, mid-battle stops and `未完待续` are explicitly forbidden on the final turn.
- Rebuilt the archived state as a return-and-seal ceremony with a stamped arrival animation, completed/emergency copy, `重读全卷`, full Markdown export, and `分享给角色`. The full download includes dual identities, worldline, scene 00, every User line, every GM beat and every character reply. Mobile/native export reuses the project's unified save/share adapter.
- Sharing with the original character writes one bounded return brief to that character's real chat, not the full 50-turn transcript. It includes the dual identities, task, seal result and final six messages, clearly states that it is a User-shared simulation archive rather than the character's pre-existing real memory, and persists `sharedAt` to prevent duplicate delivery.
- Focused verification passes 3 files / 26 tests, including the export safety audit. Vite production build succeeds with 6,175 modules. Full TypeScript reports only the existing unrelated errors and no SAR error. Mobile browser QA at 390×844 covered light/dark reading, active turn 44/50 with GM, emergency-seal confirmation, completed 50/50 return, reread, export feedback and one-time character sharing with no console errors or real model call. The official web-game client was attempted first but still cannot import its `playwright` package.

2026-09-02 — SAR 世界意志旁白层
- Replaced the visible and conceptual `SAR 航标 / GM` terminology with `世界意志`. It is defined as an objective narration-and-direction layer, not a system host or interactive NPC: it controls world reactions, countdown, pacing, climax and return, but cannot choose User or character actions, feelings, dialogue or decisions and cannot address User in first person.
- New model responses use separate `worldNarration` and `character` JSON fields, and fresh message metadata stores `sarWorldNarration`. Existing model output using `gm` and existing transcripts using `sarGM` remain readable and are rendered/exported as `世界意志`, so collected cards and active/archived runs require no migration.
- Updated runtime history, archives, character-share briefs, scene labels, generation status, emergency-seal copy and footer wording to use the same world-will framing. Focused SAR verification passes 3 files / 26 tests. Mobile in-app browser QA at 390×844 confirmed an old `sarGM` transcript renders as `世界意志`, with no visible GM/beacon wording and no console warnings or real model call.

2026-09-02 — SAR 私人异界史册与角色柜中随笔
- Rebuilt the assembly cabinet's default landing view as a per-character private chronicle. `我的柜子` groups the User's collected identity cards and 50-turn journeys by character, with active, returned, and fragment states presented as keepsake volumes rather than a flat admin list; forging remains available as a secondary action.
- Added `看看角色的柜子`. During ordinary Kanata free activity, a character may independently enter SAR, receive one random identity chip and one random otherworld-coordinate chip, and apply the pair to the User, another enabled character, or a Kanata wanderer. This is a temporary complete incident, not a copy of the User's formal 50-turn archive and not a permanent change to the target.
- The same autonomous-session model call now returns a detailed complete mini-story plus the actor's first-person notes and complaints. The result is saved as the actor's normal `vr_card`, delivered to that actor's private chat, passes through the existing memory/event pipeline, and is then discovered from chat history by the actor-owned cabinet without adding a separate backup store or another background request loop.
- Added a dedicated light-paper chat card and full cabinet-note reader showing actor, target, both chips, highlight, story, and personal notes. Focused verification passes 5 files / 87 tests; the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules. Full TypeScript still reports the repository's existing unrelated errors in Memory Palace, Companion Home, tests, and the earlier `MessageItem.tsx` pointer-event overload; no error points to the new cabinet, SAR free-activity utility, or runtime branch. The required standalone web-game client still cannot import `playwright`; a later in-app local navigation was blocked by browser security policy, so no unsupported screenshot claim is made and no real model request was sent.

2026-09-02 — SAR archive-route theme continuity
- Fixed the visually fragmented black-header / white-cabinet / black-dossier / white-session sequence shown in the mobile screenshot. Cabinet ownership tabs, character notes, identity dossiers, archived reading, and the default simulation now share one warm-paper shell, including the outer header and controls.
- Rethemed the full identity dossier rather than only recoloring its page background: identity card, steel seal, User mask, worldline, scene 00, detail sections, portraits, and actions now use the same ink, paper, sage, lavender, and rust materials as the archive.
- Dark presentation is now a deliberate device state. Entering the forge switches the complete overlay to dark; leaving it returns the complete overlay to paper. If the User explicitly toggles the formal simulation to its persisted dark theme, the parent header follows that theme too, eliminating split-tone screens.
- `render_game_to_text` now reports the active surface as `archive-light` or `machine-dark`. Focused SAR/VR verification passes 5 files / 87 tests and the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules. The required web-game client was attempted but still cannot import `playwright`; no screenshot claim is made for this pass.

2026-09-02 — SAR moonstone aether archive art direction
- Rejected the ordinary paper-library treatment and established a single magic-future thesis: otherworld sorcery has become engineered infrastructure. The archive now uses a moonstone-white atmospheric field, spectral violet/cyan coordinate lines, cut-corner translucent memory slabs, soul-index beacons, and restrained magenta seal accents rather than beige paper, generic borders, or cyberpunk neon.
- Rebuilt the first viewport around an animated coordinate spell at the right of the archive title. Cabinet ownership is a pair of aether manifolds, the character rail is a soul-link index, the selected owner becomes a stable-coordinate panel, User collections become memory crystals, character notes become private echoes, and empty shelves expose a dormant summoning circle.
- Carried the same system through the complete identity dossier and note reader: identity crystal, steel seal, User mask, worldline, timeline nodes, scene-00 panel, and primary actions now read as related arcane instruments. The forge is the dark inverse of the same palette, with an orbiting compiler ring and violet/cyan module energy instead of the previous generic laboratory surface.
- Added only three motion families—coordinate orbit, magic-heart pulse, and crystal reveal—with reduced-motion behavior retained. `render_game_to_text` identifies the visual system as `moonstone-aether-archive`. Focused verification passes cleanly in single-thread mode (5 files / 87 tests), Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules, and temporary output was removed. The required web-game client still cannot import `playwright`, so no automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-09-02 — SAR 柜子视觉收敛与铸造页复原
- Removed the moonstone pass from the forge route entirely. The assembly screen is back on its existing dark machine styling and original cabinet header contract; the new visual layer is scoped only to archive-paper surfaces.
- Simplified the cabinet into a quiet future-magic archive: a cool flat moonstone field, one static coordinate seal, restrained violet/cyan index accents, ordinary character shelves, and lightly cut keepsake volumes. Removed the continuous orbit/pulse/reveal motions, backdrop blur, oversized glow fields, layered gradients, and animated empty-state spell circles from the cabinet route.
- Updated `render_game_to_text` to report `restrained-moonstone-archive`. Focused verification passes 5 files / 87 tests, the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules, and temporary build output was removed. The required web-game client was attempted but still cannot import its standalone `playwright` dependency, so no post-change screenshot claim is made.

2026-09-03 — SAR 模块商店、每日五件与模块袋
- Added the complete fixed 46-module catalog supplied for SAR, including plain descriptions, optional Caian commentary, external-effect examples, planned ticket prices, category metadata, User-target compatibility, and configuration flags. The activity-space `模块购买` facility is now live and opens a CSS-built counter without requiring any new item art.
- The market persists five random daily arrivals and three additional manual rack rolls. The local calendar day rebuilds only the market and restores all three rolls; purchased inventory and history survive. A roll never clears the module bag, and duplicate purchases stack as consumable copies.
- Implemented the first purchase slice only: module detail, conditional Caian guide, no-NPC plain-information fallback, trial receipt, persistent module bag, and a clearly labelled unlimited trial-allocation mode while fishing currency is unfinished. Purchasing never auto-loads a character and does not yet touch Chat/Date context.
- The visual system treats the shop as a temporary SAR counter: map remains behind the full-screen overlay, while CSS sigils, serial numbers, restrained category color, two-column mobile shelving, one detail drawer, and one short receipt motion provide the merchandise layer. Reduced-motion disables all entrance transitions.
- Focused tests pass 2 files / 10 tests with cache disabled. An isolated Vite production bundle succeeds with 6,178 modules; full TypeScript reports only pre-existing unrelated repository errors and none in the new shop files. In-app browser QA at 430×900 exercised activity-room entry, five daily offers, Caian detail, trial purchase, bag persistence, and one roll from 3/3 to 2/3 with no new runtime errors. The required standalone web-game client was attempted but still cannot import its installed `playwright` dependency.
- Next slice: character selection and the load animation, then the structured 10-turn character / 5-turn User runtime with 3-turn expiry stabilization. Keep the current shop purchase and bag state as the source of consumable module copies.

2026-09-03 — SAR 模块装载、双向运行时与真言保护
- Completed the full module path from the persistent module bag through character selection, confirmation, approach/chip-loading motion, inventory consumption, and a visible installed-state receipt. Eligible targets are characters currently connected to Kanata; active or stabilizing module state is shown directly on each target.
- Added one shared persisted runtime for Chat and Date: character modules last 10 successful fresh LLM turns, User modules last 5, failed calls and rerolls never spend a turn, and expiry is followed by one explicit release reaction plus two stabilizing turns to prevent output inertia. A new installation cannot silently overwrite an already active User module.
- Added symmetric User targeting behind an explicit default-off `允许角色对我使用模块` setting. A character browsing the SAR module shop may choose and load one compatible module in the same autonomous activity call; a bounded manual reverse encounter is also possible while both parties are in SAR, with an on-map approach/loading notice.
- Isolated truth from performance with a single structured model envelope. Canonical Char/User meaning is stored as the real message and is the only version exposed to context building, Memory Palace recall, archive, relationship inference, and summaries; temporary distorted wording lives only in message metadata with an explicit non-factual annotation. Arbitrary Date input is rewritten whole rather than parsed locally.
- Chat preserves every custom bubble and adds only a small module light point that toggles the canonical line. Date highlights affected text itself and supports the same truth reveal in reading and visual modes. Commands, cards, actions, intent, facts, and relationship changes always execute from canonical output.
- Focused verification passes 5 files / 108 tests with cache disabled. The complete assertion suite previously passed 4,525 tests (the normal cache writer is locked on this Windows dev session), an isolated Vite production bundle succeeds with 6,179 modules, and mobile in-app QA covered purchase, bag, target selection, install animation, receipt, inventory decrement, and active 10-turn state with no application console errors. Full TypeScript still reports unrelated repository baseline errors, with none in this slice's touched files.

2026-09-03 — 彼方全区域抓取角色装载模块
- Corrected the module interaction direction. Buying remains exclusive to the SAR counter, but applying a purchased module now starts from the character: enter any Kanata room, tap the full chibi target, choose `抓住 TA · 使用模块`, then select a module from the bag. The character does not need to move to SAR, so the same path works while reading, dancing, exercising, or visiting any other room.
- Added a target-locked field-loadout surface that keeps the captured chibi visible, shows its current room/module state, exposes only the User's module bag, skips the redundant character picker, confirms replacement when needed, plays the existing approach/chip animation, and returns directly to the original room with `放回现场`.
- Made the complete chibi hit area keyboard/touch actionable with a stable accessible name, rather than relying on a small image hit target. The counter guide now explains the buy-in-SAR / use-anywhere division.
- Verified the full live path in the in-app browser: library chibi → character detail → capture → bag → module detail → target-locked confirmation → replacement/load animation → inventory consumption → return to the same room. Focused runtime/shop/VR tests pass 3 files / 70 tests, the isolated production build succeeds with 6,179 modules, and no new TypeScript errors appear in the touched files.

2026-09-03 — SAR Chat 气泡对齐、模块在场感与特殊模式兼容
- Replaced ordinal CHAR_SURFACE assignment with final-bubble-aware alignment. Standalone parenthesized action/narration bubbles never receive surface metadata and never consume the following polluted line, whether the model copied or omitted the action in CHAR_SURFACE.
- Strengthened the high-recency module contract from a writing-style instruction into a perceivable Kanata device. The first affected reply must notice the mismatch and react; later replies retain who installed it and include a personality-consistent awareness/coping cue without repeating mechanical exposition.
- Made built-in translation blocks atomic: one `<翻译><原文>/<译文>` pair maps to one persisted bilingual bubble, and the SAR envelope now explicitly owns the outer structure when both modes are enabled. Original and translated halves must carry the same distorted meaning. Custom same-bubble formats such as `日文（中文翻译）` remain intact and are not classified as action-only.
- Kept `<语音>` plus `<字幕>` atomic and required both CHAR fields to preserve their markup. Chat TTS now speaks the module surface while canonical `content` remains the only memory/summary truth; voice-only and foreign-voice bubbles retain the small truth toggle, whose transcript view can reveal canonical wording without changing the historically spoken audio.
- Focused verification passes 5 files / 80 tests, the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,179 modules, and filtered TypeScript reports no errors in the changed files. The temporary build directory was removed.

2026-09-06 — 彼方水域、本地布告板与信号活动封存
- Current request: continue the existing branch/context; implement fishing + a market scoped to each user's own characters and occasional local NPCs, move the ended Signal Fall event to page 3 “往期活动”. Fish artwork must be CSS/code-native, no AI image generation; dinosaur artwork will be supplied later.
- Visual thesis: muted waterside blue-green, a single circular fishing workspace, CSS fish silhouettes and warm-paper market notices. Motion is limited to the fishing ring, fish fins/hover, and brief catch/detail reveals; reduced-motion supported. Used frontend-skill and develop-web-game.
- Implemented nine CSS fish, weather-linked weighted catches with real-perception provenance/fallback, circular hold/release fishing with easy mode/fullscreen/retry, catalogue, quality-based daily sale prices, relic display/study and six-hour egg hatching. Twelve dinosaur/relic IDs have replaceable placeholders.
- Added separate wallets, deterministic per-world daily prices, 0-coin/imaginary listings, item/favor/tip requests, comments, local NPC visits, exact asset/money settlement and complete owner archives on completion/removal/24-hour expiry. Fresh-state mutations and receipt synchronization use separate Web Locks; no market backend or cross-user publication.
- Character fishing and market visits each use one normal model call (existing transport retries unchanged). The code fixes catch facts and validates transactions; the same response selects keep/release/guestbook/private-chat/market. Both transaction parties receive deduplicated vr_card facts plus exact quoted words, separate from subjective claims. Private shares and complete event details now render in chat cards.
- Backups include the complete market; corrupted raw fishing storage is exportable for recovery. Existing unrelated module-context edits were preserved, and water-specific prompt additions are scoped to water/market sessions only.
- Moved Signal entry to page 3, reduced banner size, removed admin resume button. Worker rejects archived event writes before D1 access; memorial GET only SELECTs existing records, preserving unfinished poems and original booklet sizes. Old creation/seed/append code removed and post-office bundle regenerated. No online deployment or remote deletion performed.
- Verification: 50 new fishing/market/character-session/Worker assertions pass; combined prior run of SAR/Chat/Date/VR and new tests passed 186 assertions (187 after the added real-weather case). Full run: 4,589 pass and 2 pre-existing amsgInstantChat.wiring source-anchor failures, confirmed already mismatched in HEAD. Full TypeScript has only existing errors after fixing the new lock callback typing. Isolated production build succeeds (6,186 modules).
- Resolved the skill client dependency issue using bundled Playwright plus existing Edge and a scoped ESM loader. Cached the project's existing Tailwind CDN script for offline test styling. Ran the official web-game client and inspected screenshots/state. Additional mobile QA passes catch/cancel/escape/fullscreen/catalogue/0-price listing/comment/archive/buy/tip/reload at 390px and 320px. Real OS/Music Provider integration passes page 1 → SAR → water → page 3 → read-only memorial; no application page errors or real LLM requests.
- QA scripts/fixtures and detailed boundaries are documented in apps/vrWorld/FISHING.md. Screenshots/cache/build output are under ignored output/fishing-qa and output/fishing-build. Remaining user-supplied input: dinosaur images. Worker freeze takes effect online only after deployment; module-shop paid-currency integration deliberately remains off.

2026-09-06 — Separate SAR water and noticeboard entrances
- User correction: water and noticeboard are two entrances. Split the SAR facilities into parallel 水域 / 布告板 buttons, retaining existing CSS artwork, palette and restrained interaction motion.
- Each entrance now has its own title, two-item navigation and character activity control; board opens on prices without loading weather. Shared wallet/inventory/price persistence and character activity logic remain unchanged. Listing from a catch transitions to the board; both close back to SAR.
- Verified direct board entry, water-to-listing transition, return paths and shared-state preservation at 390px / 320px with both mobile and real-provider integration scripts; no page errors. Ran the official web-game client, inspected game state and screenshots of both entries, water, board and small-screen layouts. Focused tests pass 4 files / 98 assertions, and isolated Vite build succeeds (6,186 modules). No new TypeScript diagnostics in this slice's changed components. No prompt/economy/Worker logic changed in this correction; no deployment performed.

2026-09-09 — Mobile dinosaur cafe art prototype
- User asks for mobile-first, simple rounded 3D toy dinosaurs based on their pastel reference, with a cozy cafe sandbox. Art approval comes before complete fishing/gameplay integration. Previous SAR diorama was removed at user request and stays removed.
- Isolated in `.worktrees/dino-cafe-art`, branch `codex/dino-cafe-art`, based on `codex/kanata-update`; root checkout belongs to other ongoing work.
- Created five offline generated, continuous-surface GLB dinosaur models and a standalone Three.js cafe preview at `/prototypes/dino-cafe/index.html` (Vite port 5182). Four default residents, close-up view, touch orbit/zoom, tap placement, rotate, greeting, reset. No fishing inventory/economy changes.
- Mobile rendering limits: DPR 1.4, 30 fps animation cap, static 1024 shadow map, cafe geometry batched with vertex colors. Five models total 985 KiB / 6.7–8.7k triangles each / one draw per model. Default four-resident cafe: 49,872 triangles and 18 draw calls in steady frames. Real device performance not yet measured.
- Inspected actual 390px, 320px, landscape, desktop, placement, and all five portrait renders with the image viewer. Fixed sliced framing, lumpy curve silhouettes, overlapping residents, excessive draw calls, hidden placement feedback, and landscape action clipping. Continuous bodies are sculpted offline with curved fields and simplified before GLB export.
- Official game skill Playwright client completed without errors. Supplementary mobile QA passes placement/rejection/cancel, rotation, greeting, reset, touch orbit, pinch zoom, all model portraits and viewport layout checks. TypeScript scope and isolated production build pass. Build reports the expected large Three.js entry chunk (218 KB gzip).
- Next: get user feedback on this art preview before integrating collection counts, saved layouts, furniture collisions, routes, and cafe-specific antics. See prototypes/dino-cafe/README.md for commands, budgets, boundaries and gameplay direction. No deployment or main-game integration in this art round.

2026-09-09 — Shared clay dinosaur gardens, painting and hidden grid
- User replaced cafe with a sandbox, excluded battles, requested per-individual colours, then corrected material to clay/playdough. Later refinements: smaller dinosaurs, all characters share multiple maps with six residents per map, a hidden fixed grid for touch and LLM positioning, much more differentiated cute scenery.
- Implemented twelve clay GLBs with separate vertex-colour weights for body/detail paint; kept the mobile renderer and reduced scene scale from .72 to .49. Replaced cafe UI with garden / collection and per-toy name, paint, original/current stage, origins and visit history.
- Added grassland, crescent-shell coast and volcanic expedition layouts. After user rejected recycled bridge/fence assets, split scenic compositions: only grassland uses the stream/bridge/bunting; coast has lighthouse/palms/umbrella/starfish/sailboat; volcano has lava forks/crystals/rock columns/supplies. Each map persists independently; one toy occupies one map.
- Shared hidden board: 30 stable cells, eight headings, six residents per map regardless of owner. Touch positions snap; model chooses a cell or semantic near/face anchor. Availability, props, revisions, fixed state and map are checked at application time. White landing dots show only while placing.
- Integrated SAR entrance and fishing-collection return. First actual garden grants one deduplicated gift; demo has clearly labelled samples. Same fishing storage and backup preserve individual origins/paint/names/story through map moves and gifts. Legacy free-placement preview migrates to cells; malformed storage is never overwritten.
- Real character visits use the existing persona/API/session pipeline, one action with exact quoted words and factual receipts. User originals remain immutable; signed continuations and reversible visit changes append history. Online scheduler has frequency limits. Closed-app background visits are NOT implemented and UI/docs say so.
- Verified 52 focused assertions, including real session pipeline with fake API. Fixed Web Lock callback rejection recovery (sync throws could leave the Node lock blocked); browser writes and next operations now complete after invalid actions. Mobile QA passes touch grid movement/rotation, scene switching, paint/cancel/reload, stage/visit/undo, collection portraits and 390/320/landscape. Real OS/Music Provider SAR → garden → fishing → garden passes without live model requests. Full Vite app build succeeded; whole-repo TypeScript has pre-existing diagnostics, with targeted changed-file diagnostics checked separately.
- All work remains in codex/dino-cafe-art worktree. Root checkout untouched; no deployment, merge or commit. Details and reproduction: apps/vrWorld/DINOSAUR-GARDEN.md, prototypes/dino-cafe/README.md.
- Final differentiated-scene pass: coast has no bridge, fence or bunting; volcanic lava now connects down the mountain. Fixed landscape landmarks share positions with collision checks, so touch placement, props, character actions and legacy migration cannot intersect the umbrella/lighthouse/sailboat. Added one regression, bringing focused tests to 53 passing. Re-ran official game client, visually inspected all three scenes, and exercised touch placement/restore on coast and volcano as well as grassland. Mobile QA has no console errors. Full app production build passed after the scenery rewrite; final prototype build also passed after landmark occupancy fix. Existing whole-repo TypeScript errors remain outside this change. Real-device frame-rate measurement and closed-app background visits remain follow-up work.

2026-09-09 — SAR room artwork, cast and temporary portrait layout editor
- Connected the user's room image, original-pixel red/common and green/fishing foot mask, five extracted facility points and extra dinosaur entrance on the coffee table. NPCs and visitors share deterministic collision-separated placements; overflow uses the roster. Facilities retain their real VRWorldApp callbacks.
- Copied the two supplied chibis as original 472-square canvases. Corrected an initial transparent-margin crop that enlarged NPCs: they now share visitor base dimensions and foot alignment. Existing visitor custom transforms remain supported.
- Registered 13 GitHub SAR standing portraits through the existing CdnImg mirror chain, with expression fallback and last-ready retention. Room uses local chibis only; dialogues display both smaller standing portraits with cinematic black bars and an opaque, dimmed inactive speaker. Existing Caian script preserved; added fixed Aiven fishing/garden guidance.
- User wants to calibrate overlapping portraits themselves. Added a temporary editor at `/prototypes/sar-art/index.html?edit=portraits`, with separate scale/x/y sliders, front/back order, actual dialogue preview, browser-local autosave, copyable parameters, reset and mobile collapse. Initial editor draft is 112% of previous portrait sizes. Await user's final layout; do not promote their draft to production defaults until they finish. Read parameters from its visible textarea or `sar-art:portrait-layout-draft:v1` in the same browser.
- Focused tests: 19 pass. Mobile/integrated artwork QA passes all 13 expressions, 6 facilities, alignment and SAR → dialogue → actual garden. Editor slider/overlap/persistence/reset/390/320 and identical default chibi width checks pass. Inspected desktop/mobile screenshots with the image viewer. Production Vite build passes (6,216 modules). Targeted TypeScript only reports the existing two `utils/apiCallLog.ts:708` role diagnostics.
- Official game client run in restricted network correctly displayed image retry placeholders; repeated with public-network access to verify actual remote assets. See output/sar-art-qa/official-network for the final result. Artwork docs: apps/vrWorld/SAR-ART.md. Still only codex/dino-cafe-art worktree; no merge, commit or deployment.
- User finalized portrait layout: both scale 150, Caian x 27 / Aiven x 75, y 0, front auto. Promoted to production defaults. Choices now float at the center of the dialogue viewport, outside the fixed 164px portrait-mode dialogue box; long dialogue scrolls inside and resets to top on the next line. Geometry checks verify no stage/cast/dialogue movement when lines or choices change.
- Further user correction on resizing: replaced width-based, bottom-anchored portrait scaling with height-based sizing and each original image's aspect ratio. At approved 150%, portrait height is stage height minus 24px and top anchors to the headroom line; scaling extends downwards. Same-height width changes preserve size; landscape shrinks to its available stage height without clipping heads. Inspected 390/320 and landscape renders; QA adds explicit headroom and width-resize assertions. Editor still exists, but the user's layout is now the formal default.
- Final geometry QA passes including 24px headroom at all tested sizes, width-only resizing without character growth, centered choices outside dialogue, and fixed frames across long/short lines. Official client captured both real remote portraits and choices successfully (output/sar-art-qa/official-headroom), no console errors; inspected its screenshot. Final production build succeeds with 6,217 modules. No deployment or commit.

2026-09-09 — SAR per-line emotional performance
- User asks for a richer performance across the entire introduction, including Caian becoming embarrassed immediately when Aiven undercuts him. Replaced coarse per-node expression defaults with 98 individually directed lines using all seven Caian expressions, plus 19 explicit listener reactions. Existing dialogue words, branch conditions and completion flags are preserved.
- Added typed `SARCastExpressions` to each line and renderer. Resolve full cast snapshots after condition filtering, preserving reactions inside each node and resetting at the next node. Aiven's punchlines affect listening Caian on the same beat; the following defensive response stays embarrassed. Curiosity, enthusiastic explanations, awkward recovery and Aster recollections have distinct expressions; Aiven listens with interest/sadness or softens into a smile where appropriate.
- Six focused story tests pass, including eight punchline/reply pairs, condition branches, non-mutating snapshots and node reset. Targeted TypeScript still has only the two existing apiCallLog.ts:708 diagnostics. Production build passes (6,217 modules). Mobile/provider QA passes actual listener-image switching, Aster's paired emotions, all prior layout checks and integration; inspected the resulting images.
- Browser QA first reloaded during a simultaneous full build, so repeated successfully after build completion. Run production builds and browser QA sequentially because generated HTML can trigger Vite reloads. Official skill client rerun uses output/sar-art-qa/official-expressions. Root checkout unchanged; no commit/merge/deployment.

2026-09-09 — Distinguish villainess and tsundere module prompts
- User clarified 恶役大小姐 as Japanese 悪役令嬢 / お嬢様口調 (〜ですわ) and wants separation from 傲娇. Added model-only `promptRules` to module definitions. Villainess now emphasizes poised confidence, ornate politeness and natural Japanese endings; tsundere emphasizes awkward denial and embarrassment. Both respect existing language/translation settings, canonical intent and original character identity.
- Updated the two shop descriptions and villainess example. Rules explicitly distinguish their added stylistic features, keep each effect scoped to its corresponding user's/character's surface field, and do not invent hidden romantic intentions or aristocratic backstory. Titles/IDs, duration, inventory and prices are unchanged.
- `activeLine` resolves detailed rules from the current catalog so already-installed snapshots receive the fix without save mutation or reinstallation; expired effects do not reinject rules. Existing modules without detailed rules retain the previous path.
- Runtime/shop regression checks pass 23 tests, including old installed state, active/afterglow behavior, different simultaneous character/user effects and unaffected unrelated modules. Full production build passes (6,217 modules). No live LLM generation/evaluation was invoked; verification covers prompt assembly and existing contracts. Worktree only, no commit/merge/deployment.
- User clarified the intended sound is Japanese-villainess translation style in Chinese, with the actual language always following the character's settings. Updated the prompt, label and shop example accordingly: Chinese remains Chinese and uses elegant, haughty translated-anime phrasing; ですわ is a style reference, not a suffix to paste into Chinese. Native Japanese endings apply only to Japanese-speaking characters, and other languages/translation formats retain their own language. Re-ran the 23 runtime/shop checks after this text-only clarification; all pass.

## 2026-09-10 · Dinosaur backyard interaction and product UI
- User accepted a garden-first backyard direction and explicitly asked for simple, guided product UI. Keep each map at six dinosaurs; replace the action/target form with one optional sentence.
- Visual thesis: a quiet cream-and-sage clay toy garden, with the whole group as the main view. Content: garden first, three bottom entrances (decorate / dinosaurs / visits), contextual dinosaur sheet, optional first-use guide. Motion: local prop docking and distinct activities, small greeting/ambient cues, quick sheet entry; reduced motion stays still.
- Added shared spatial activities (tent nap, picnic snack, flower hide/sniff, puddle/coast splash, tree leaves, stump lookout), open tent geometry and three walkable props. Local animations share facts with character visits, preserve grid coordinates and user text, respect fixed toys and neighbours, pause offscreen, and use no LLM calls per frame.
- Added concise property-use labels, contextual placement guidance and one-tap named interaction spots. Kept ownership, paint, gifting, catalog, event replies/undo and old save compatibility. First entry no longer opens a permanent selected-dinosaur tray.
- First QA: 59 focused tests passed after correcting a negative walking bob that could sink a fixed toy into the floor. Official game client ran and its screenshot/state were inspected. Mobile QA verified all twelve models, touch picking/orbit, sentence save, paint save/cancel, fixed position, real prop activity, visit/undo, and 320/390/landscape layouts. Additional final checks in progress.
- Final validation: 60 focused tests passed. Added delayed sentence-only character result coverage across map switches. Updated mobile QA also passed named quick-placement, stump animation, and reduced-motion stability. Real OS/SAR → garden → fishing collection → garden integration passed without minting another starter or losing data.
- Inspected the final 390 px garden, resident sheet, single-sentence editor, placement strip, furniture menu, stump interaction, 320 px sheet, and landscape screenshots. Production build passed (6,218 modules). Focused TypeScript still reports only the two pre-existing utils/apiCallLog.ts:708 role union errors; no new type diagnostics. No actual-phone performance or live-LLM evaluation claimed.
- Intentionally limited to local movement between a saved cell and its nearby prop, not general autonomous roaming; no offline visits or hand-painted textures added. This turn is local/uncommitted. Earlier requested Caian greeting change remains intact.

## 2026-09-10 · Explicit placement and stationary play
- User rejected instant writes, text destinations and drifting animations. Replaced them with local placement drafts for both new/existing props and dinosaurs. Grid preview, emissive highlight, direction arrow, invalid reasons, rotation, Cancel and explicit Confirm. Final mutation rechecks revision/map/ownership/capacity/collision; cancel produces no events or phantom props. Prop removal now has an inline confirmation.
- Clickable prop meshes, paw markers with touch tolerance, illustrated prop palette, contextual “让恐龙来玩” selecting a collection toy and previewing a viable interaction cell. Decorations no longer pretend to have supported play actions.
- Saved x/z/facing remain authoritative in every frame. Head/tail/feet morphs preserve one body draw call; visible cookie/crumbs, foot splashes/ripples, flower/leaf sway, sleeping breathing and static stump support. No roaming or calendar-driven animation. Existing identity, words, paint, visits, 6-per-map and old saves preserved.
- Initial 67 focused tests pass. Updated full mobile browser QA passes draft/cancel/invalid/confirm/new-prop identity, scene picking, stationary anchors, saved refresh, 12 species, 3 maps, visits/undo, and 320/390/844 layouts. Inspected menu, dino/prop preview, scene affordance sheet, landscape preview screenshots. Fixed inherited button grid-area overlap discovered by real clicking and improved sparse flower mesh hit targets. Final integration/build/official client checks follow.
- Final validation: full mobile QA reran successfully after touch-target and landscape control polish; official web-game client completed and its final screenshot was inspected. Real SAR / fishing collection round-trip passed with the same starter and unchanged saved garden. Production build passed with 6,221 modules in 33.48 s. TypeScript has only the two pre-existing apiCallLog.ts:708 role errors. Root checkout remains clean. Changes remain local in codex/dino-cafe-art; no commit/push/deploy.

## 2026-09-10 · Fix “让恐龙来玩” dead ends
- Reproduced original stumps with zero valid grid interaction poses; also found the old planner collapsed occupancy/capacity/static-collectible failures into a generic nearby-space message. Added one shared play planner for the collection and scene, searching all eight facings and checking actual activity assignment.
- A free legacy prop with no usable spot now offers an explicit paired prop/dinosaur preview. It highlights both and commits both atomically only on confirmation. Cancel writes nothing; no other dinosaur or prop moves. Availability/reasons appear before selection. Preview now includes static perch support height.
- 72 focused tests pass, including every default interactive prop across all maps, original stump regression, paired identity/preview/cancel/stale revision, occupied/static/full cases. Mobile browser regression passed selecting the old stump, paired cancel and confirm, reload retention and unchanged neighbours. Inspected play list, paired preview, perched dinosaur and official client screenshots. Final build check follows.
- Final: full mobile QA reran successfully with the perch-height assertion; latest paired preview and official-client screenshots inspected. Production build passed (6,221 modules, 57.21 s); TypeScript retains only the two known apiCallLog.ts:708 errors. No commit or push.


2026-09-10 — Garden rendering and SAR user guide
- Confirmed real integration is lazy-loaded from VRWorldApp, with the SAR coffee-table and fishing collection entrances; current new edits remain local in codex/dino-cafe-art.
- Added docs/sar-user-guide.md, verified against current handlers: NPC scripts vs real character turns, all SAR facility flows, recent 10 garden facts vs absent lifetime statistics, events/undo, normal 1-generation visits vs conditional memory overhead, simulation 1 forge + up to 50 turns, reverse-module local vs LLM paths, existing development-mode economy switches.
- Renderer now pauses hidden catalog and static portraits/placement/reduced-motion scenes, wakes for controls/paint/preferences, caps drawing pixels at 1M, and refreshes animated shadows at 3 Hz. Incremental props reuse geometry, species morphs are prepared once, particles use one instanced draw per active dinosaur, and disposal explicitly releases the context.
- Actual screenshot inspection caught transparent instanced prop rings obscuring terrain even though functional tests passed. Kept individual ground circles; rechecked terrain in the official client's screenshot. No diagnostic wireframe or temporary renderer globals remain.
- Performance QA: same four-dino 390x844/DPR2 view went from 59/74 calls to 44/59; static/hidden sampling adds 0 frames, terrain/prop builds stay 1/9 after a prop rotation, templates stay 4 across repeated portraits, GPU geometry/texture counts stable, 1920x1080 drawing buffer 998898 pixels.
- Real integration QA passed: SAR entry, starter, fishing collection, return/save continuity, mobile widths 390/320; both created WebGL contexts explicitly lost on exit. Focused typecheck still reports only the two pre-existing utils/apiCallLog.ts:708 role union errors.
- Final validation: 72/72 focused tests, full product browser regression, performance regression and real-entry/context-disposal regression passed. Final official screenshot and mobile stump/coast screenshots visually checked. Production build passed (6221 modules, 54.27s). Main E:/NMJ/SullyOS checkout remains clean; no commit or push performed.

2026-09-10 — SAR fishing ownership and personal unlocks
- Simplified character fishing to one JSON generation: keep/release + reaction + optional ordinary DM. Market decisions remain in the bulletin-board visit.
- Added persisted pending trips, ownership reservation, replay-safe settlement, per-character lifetime acquisition history, conservative legacy reconstruction, and clay release rejection.
- Added local public guestbook first-species announcements (user confirmed local all-character scope), event receipts, retriable delivery outbox, atomic deduped chat writes and atomic shared board appends.
- Current verification: 52 fishing tests passed; 19 garden behavior/placement/activity and 57 VR baseline tests passed; 2 real DB delivery/concurrency tests passed after guarding the optional browser event in Node. Browser acceptance and final build in progress.
- Existing unrelated anniversary/theme edits in the shared worktree were left alone. No commit or push requested this turn.

2026-09-10 — SAR fishing completed validation
- User clarified Caian/Aiven remain fixed-script NPCs; fixture characters were renamed 阿岚/小舟. No NPC autonomy added.
- Final focused fishing + real IndexedDB concurrency/durability coverage: 58 tests passing; related garden/VR suites: 90 passing (148 total).
- Real UI/DB acceptance at 390/320 passed with mocked model responses: 5 catches, 6 attempted generations including one deliberately failed request, 2 personal unlocks, 2 public announcements. Delivery-only retry adds zero calls. Real guestbook renderer and ordinary text-message persistence verified.
- Inspected final release/share panel, 320px acquisition-count/date catalog, public announcements, and official web-game client canvas screenshot. Console errors were only the intentionally injected HTTP 503 and its expected caught API error.
- Production build passed in 37.41s. Feature TS check reports only 8 pre-existing diagnostics in apiCallLog, builtinSullyLive2D, memoryPalace/pipeline and qixiMemoryBundle; no diagnostics in the changed feature.
- Updated docs/sar-user-guide.md. All work remains local on codex/dino-cafe-art; no commit/push this turn.

2026-09-10 — SAR formal simulation offline only
- Removed online/offline controls; new forge openings and runtime turns use in-person speech/actions. Legacy communications and archive metadata retained without reinterpreting historical facts.
- Updated user guide. 18 simulation tests pass; real cabinet browser QA at 390/320 checks continuation, one mocked model call, legacy archive, theme, reload and sealing. Official client screenshot and 320px screenshot inspected.
- Scoped TypeScript check: 5 existing diagnostics in apiCallLog, memoryPalace/pipeline and qixiMemoryBundle; none in this change. No commit/push.
- Next user request: inspect internal market and add manual-only Kanata participation, preserving existing scheduled users.

2026-09-10 — Manual Kanata participation, grouped pagination, and market check
- Added persisted manual/scheduled participation. New joins default manual; legacy enabled users keep scheduled behavior. UI offers both modes, schedules only automatic users, removes stale plans, and permits explicit invitations.
- Chat framing keeps manual participants aware of Kanata without fabricating autonomous outings. Session writes preserve the newest participation flags, so an in-flight response cannot undo a switch to manual/off.
- Access list filters by existing character groups, mounts at most five character rows per page, and resets page on group changes. Verified 8/4-member groups, disjoint pages and 320px layout.
- Browser acceptance through real OS providers and SAR entry passed: stale automatic trigger produces zero model calls; explicit invitation produces one; in-flight toggle and refresh preserve manual; board tip pays once and a stale repeat cannot pay again. Model calls were mocked; no user API calls or production data were used. Mobile/manual, pagination, market and official client screenshots inspected.
- Updated docs/sar-user-guide.md with manual access and honest board boundaries (no escrow; private share still lives inside activity card; bounded model view).
- Final branch checks: 219 tests across 22 suites passed, including SAR/garden/fishing/market, chat prompts and anniversary changes; production build passed (37.82s on the previous pass, final pagination build also successful). Scoped TypeScript has the same 8 pre-existing diagnostics, no new feature errors.
- User requested committing/pushing the entire current branch. Include all current product/source/assets/docs/tests; exclude generated output/. Remote codex/dino-cafe-art fetched and matched local HEAD before committing.

2026-09-10 — Quiet bulletin-board pages
- User request: simplify the cluttered board UI and move operations into subpages.
- Visual thesis: warm paper, dark ink, one muted green action; a readable board with generous space.
- Content plan: one combined note feed and one write action; detail/publish pages; quotes, history and invitations under More.
- Interaction thesis: short page entrance, subtle note hover, preserved reading position; respect reduced motion.
- Implemented page hierarchy and explicit pay/receive button labels. Preserve the existing ledger and real/text item rules. Browser verification pending.
- Final validation: market browser regression passes transactions, all four publish paths, exact/stale specimens, aliases, scroll restoration, Escape/cancel, collection-to-publish round trip, archives and reload at 320/390/1024 px. Real SAR entry regression passes. Zero browser page errors; no real model calls or user data used.
- Official web-game client ran after layout changes; inspected current screenshots and text state. Production build passed (16.28 s). Full TypeScript still reports unrelated pre-existing errors; none in FishingMarketOverlay.
- New screenshot gallery: output/fishing-qa/board-clean/gallery.html, with nine current screens and a link to the earlier screenshots. Verified every image loads and all gallery navigation works.
- UI work complete; no commit or push. The earlier discussion of character cancellation/retry/settlement boundaries remains separate from this presentation change.

2026-09-10 — World will and simulation reading surfaces
- User authorized the narrative principles discussed above and simultaneous UI refinement.
- Visual thesis: a quiet book-like reading surface, warm paper/dark ink, one muted green accent; story takes the screen.
- Content plan: readable scene and character text first; opening preview and one start/continue action; identities/background/details on demand. No permanent crisis dashboard or spoiler panel.
- Interaction thesis: gentle message arrival, unobtrusive new-message affordance while rereading, short subpage transitions; reduced-motion support.
- Narrative work: replace coercive forge/runtime/phase instructions; distinguish story time from turn budget; allow quiet narration; persist bounded director facts in the same response, with no extra model calls.
- Implemented shared narrative principles for forge and runtime, quieter phase guidance, optional narration, and bounded director facts persisted with assistant messages. Reject malformed structured output without spending a turn; preserve legacy plain text and previous valid continuity. Director facts stay out of the reader and exported archive.
- Rebuilt identity previews and simulation reading pages in warm paper/ink with a persisted dark theme. Move progress, background, settings and early seal into a details page; hide spoilers and duplicate headers. New replies respect rereading position. Ordinary return pauses; sealing explains that it ends the run.
- Validation: 22 narrative/simulation unit tests passed. Browser regression passed quiet replies, private continuity across reload, legacy replies, malformed JSON/retry, rereading scroll, theme persistence, archive download, early seal, and the final 50th interaction at 320/390/1100 px. All model replies were mocked in isolated fixture storage; zero real model calls and zero browser page errors.
- Official web-game client rerun shows the actual reader with matching sar-simulation text state. Inspected mobile card/reading/detail/archive screenshots and desktop reading. Final production build passed (31.47 s); full TypeScript has existing unrelated diagnostics, with none in this feature on the scoped check. git diff --check passed.
- Screenshot gallery: output/fishing-qa/sar-reader/gallery.html. Ten images, page navigation and overview verified. User-facing gallery contains static screenshots only and does not seed user storage.
- Implementation and UI pass complete. Real-model narrative quality still needs a live reading session; mock tests verify the protocol and UI, not the model's long-term storytelling compliance. No commit or push performed.

2026-09-10 — Refine the story composer
- User request: make the sending field feel more considered and less dated.
- Visual thesis: one quiet ivory writing surface with an integrated, muted green send action.
- Content plan: text first, one short placeholder, one send button; no extra tools or helper copy.
- Interaction thesis: focus gently reveals the boundary; text grows within a bounded height; the send button gains color when ready and responds subtly to hover/press, respecting reduced motion.
- Replaced separate textarea box and round paper-plane button with a unified writing bar, borderless auto-growing text and an inset arrow key. Kept a 44 px send target and Chinese composition-safe keyboard handling. New-content control follows the actual composer height.
- Browser regression passed auto-grow/clear, long draft scrolling, same-width viewport shrink, whitespace disabled state, Chinese IME confirmation, Shift+Enter newline and Enter send, plus all prior reader/retry/archive checks. Found and fixed draft overflow becoming hidden when only viewport height shrinks.
- Inspected idle, writing, dark, long-draft and 320 px screenshots. Official skill client rerun and text state verified; no browser errors or real model calls. Final production build passed (15.50 s), git diff --check clean.
- Updated the existing reader screenshots and added a six-view comparison gallery at output/fishing-qa/sar-reader/composer-gallery.html; every image and navigation verified. No commit or push.
- Follow-up: vertically centered the send button inside the writing bar, including multi-line drafts. Refreshed the gallery screenshots, reran browser checks and the official client, and inspected the centered two-line input.

2026-09-10 — Connect SAR purchases to the shared game wallet
- User request: end unlimited gacha and free module claiming now that the feature is ready. Found hard-coded development flags in both screens and unused shop credits.
- Asked about currency/pricing while auditing storage; after the optional response window proceeded with stated defaults: shared existing 鳞币, one free draw per pool per local day, then 30 coins, catalog module prices unchanged. No real-money integration or model calls.
- Atomic commerce stores paid inventory and wallet in one fishing-market write, serialized with existing market mutations and Web Locks where available. Stable request IDs prevent duplicate charges. Stale free quotes do not silently become paid; each mutation reads current wallet, offers and inventory. Storage failure does not publish a grant.
- Existing inventories migrate once without retroactive fees; canonical reads and backups preserve the migrated record. Removed paid-inventory truncation, kept legacy credits as unused history, and made helper storage errors explicit. Corrupt wallet data remains exportable as raw backup.
- UI shows balance, exact cost, insufficient balance and saved receipts; refreshes across pages. Module use reads fresh inventory before applying a module so stale UI cannot clone a consumed item.
- Validation so far: 78 focused unit tests pass, including 12 commerce cases; browser payments pass double click, free/paid draws, buy/reload, closing before reveal, shared wallet updates, insufficient balance and quota failure at 390/320 px. Scoped TypeScript has no changed-feature diagnostics; full project still has unrelated existing errors.
- Final validation: 79 focused tests pass (13 commerce cases, including partial legacy restore after migration). Browser also verified two pages racing for the final 30 coins, and buying then installing on a real fixture character: exactly one inventory unit consumed, no second charge, persisted runtime active. Official client screenshot/text state inspected; no browser page errors or real model calls.
- Added an eight-screen gallery at output/fishing-qa/sar-commerce/gallery.html; images and navigation verified. Production build passed. No commit/push or live user-store edits; all browser checks used isolated fixture contexts.

2026-09-10 — SAR room, personal warehouse and economy
- Visual thesis: a continuous light surface from Kanata header to the illustrated SAR room, with quiet moss-green controls.
- Content plan: two top-right game buttons, NPC settings and a personal warehouse; balances and inventory live inside the warehouse with an owner selector.
- Interaction thesis: tactile icon presses, short sheet entrance and inventory selection; keyboard focus, back/escape and reduced-motion support.
- Economy plan: new wallets 120, two free daily draws then 30, modules 18–34, lower fish valuations and 180 daily system buyback per actor. Preserve legacy money/items. Character spending must use its own wallet and owned inventory.

- User refined navigation during implementation: SAR belongs beside World as a primary entry and opens as an independent full-screen room. Removed the nested World page, global header/tabs and SAR pagination; added return to Kanata. World now has rooms + archives, with its archive return corrected. Settings/warehouse remain inside SAR.

- Completed: independent SAR primary entrance beside World, full-screen light room, return to Kanata, settings/warehouse tools, and World archive navigation. Settings reuse the NPC preference; warehouse switches all characters with actual ownership, statuses, filters, details and active effect display.
- Economy implemented: new wallets 120; common fish bases 8–12, all bases 8–90, ±10% daily variation, quality 1/1.15/1.3; per-actor system buyback 180 per local day; incoming wallet cap 999,999 while legacy balances/assets are preserved. Refused income leaves the item intact.
- Character module purchases now choose browse/buy using their own wallet, 60 daily purchase budget and 30 reserve. Owned units are reused and actually consumed for user effects; reverse install cannot generate a free unit. Model-only claims do not grant items.
- Validation: 116 focused unit tests passed, including 13 new economy/ownership tests and a 366-day all-species/all-quality bound. Real provider browser checks passed for 320/390/1100 px, NPC persistence, full-screen entrance/return, archives, independent wallets/bags, cross-tab updates, empty states, focus/escape and four mocked character shop sessions. Existing commerce and Kanata integration also passed; zero page errors or real model calls.
- Official game client rerun after the navigation change; current screenshot and text state inspected (tab=sar). Final production build passed in 31.75 s; git diff --check clean. Earlier scoped TypeScript check had no changed-feature errors, while the full project retains unrelated diagnostics.
- New gallery: output/fishing-qa/sar-hub/gallery.html, eleven screenshots including primary entrance, full-screen room, NPC settings and user/character warehouse. Every image and gallery navigation verified. docs/sar-economy.md records the numerical plan and sampled valuation ranges; user/implementation docs updated.
- No commit, push, live payment integration or live user-store changes performed. Runtime effect persistence still follows the existing OS profile storage lifecycle; the economic atomic guarantee covers wallet plus purchased inventory, not an IndexedDB/localStorage cross-store install transaction.


2026-09-10 — Collection atlas and Kanata titles
- User requests: warehouse atlas for fish/dinosaurs/chips/modules with per-owner progress; distinguish facility controls from character names; optional custom titles above characters, names below, and titles known/editable during the actor's own Kanata activities.
- Visual thesis: retain the light moss/ivory warehouse; atlas enters from one small header button, with four progress rows and category pages. Facilities use solid green plaques/icons, character names use quiet foot labels, titles use a small warm accent above the avatar.
- Content plan: current inventory remains separate from distinct historical collection; preserve legacy items in a small collection journal before consumption, with no duplicate-copy inflation. Title editing lives with the selected owner in the warehouse.
- Interaction thesis: bounded atlas pages/search/status filtering and nested back navigation; deliberate title save/cancel; skip motion under reduced motion. Title updates share the existing activity model response and protect intervening user edits with a revision.

- Completed: warehouse atlas with four category totals (9/12/49/46), personal historical collection/current quantities, search/status filtering/pagination/detail views and nested keyboard/system back. Legacy module ownership is journaled before final-unit consumption, persisted with the market and backup. No historical dates or temporary-chip ownership invented.
- Completed: facility green icon plaques, quiet foot names, optional warm head titles, label-aware placement and title offsets for enlarged chibis. Warehouse supports self/character title edits, 12 Unicode characters, save/cancel/clear. Existing enable settings are preserved.
- Completed: current title in ordinary chat and all Kanata activity prompts. Optional XML/JSON self-title metadata stripped before original parsers; successful activities apply guarded changes only to their actor. Empty/malformed activities do not rename; manual edits, edit-and-revert revisions and disabling participation defeat stale updates. Optional title-save failure does not misreport a committed activity as failed. Scheduled fire-pack templates omit a potentially stale title.
- Validation: 143 focused unit tests passed across 14 files, including 15 new collection/title tests. Existing full-provider SAR hub check passed; new 320/390/1100 browser checks passed with zero page errors and six mocked model activities (XML edit, JSON edit, malformed activity rejection, in-flight manual priority, title-only rejection, clear). Manual title persistence/clear, owner isolation, last-unit consumption, missing/search/pagination, nested focus/back and phone label collision checks passed. No real model calls or live user storage modifications.
- Final production build passed in 31.00 s. Full TypeScript check still has pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, CompanionHome, old output audit/tests and Vite config; no diagnostics in this feature's source or tests. git diff --check passed.
- Official game client ran; screenshot and state show tab=sar. Its unmocked initial world screen reports blocked pre-existing remote room thumbnails (jsDelivr and fallback hosts, ERR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED); traced independently. SAR art and the feature UI use local assets and render correctly. Dedicated feature browser checks mock external requests.
- Delivered gallery: output/fishing-qa/sar-collection/gallery.html, 15 verified images with phone/desktop layouts, room labels, title editor, four atlas categories and a consumed module still collected. Opened via Codex browser panel (queued). No commit or push.

- User visual correction: dislikes green specifically on facility entrances. Changed board/modules/chips/gacha/fishing/garden plaques to warm ivory with coffee text, tan markers and a fine wooden-tone edge. Preserved icon/shape distinction from character labels. Re-captured all 15 gallery views; full collection/title browser verification still passed. The 31 s production build above precedes this final CSS palette adjustment; no logic changed.


2026-09-11 — Hide SAR room overlays
- User asks for a toggle beside settings that hides character names, titles and facility controls together.
- Visual thesis: keep the room illustration and avatars in place; one eye button reveals or removes the room labels, with the existing warm ivory facilities unchanged.
- Content plan: a third compact top-right tool, hidden-state recovery always available; names, titles, markers, NPC exclamation and occupant roster disappear together.
- Interaction thesis: instant reversible toggle without avatar repositioning; preserve preference across reload and retain the existing pressed-button feedback. Hidden facility controls are removed from pointer/keyboard interaction.

- Implemented persisted labelsHidden preference in SAR club state, Eye/EyeSlash control beside settings, and CSS hiding for room labels, title text, facility/nav markers, NPC quest badge, roster and text-only avatar initials. Avatars and positions remain stable; visible top controls remain available. Compact header spacing supports 320 px.
- Verified both real-provider browser suites: toggle/hide/show, keyboard activation, hidden facility non-interactivity, visible avatars/unchanged feet, settings access, persistence in both directions after reload, 320 px header fit, existing atlas/title and six mocked activity sessions, and existing hub economic flows. Zero page errors in isolated suites. Six SAR club unit tests passed. Production build passed in 1m 1s.
- Updated gallery with two hide-state screenshots (17 total). No live model calls, production user-store edits, commit or push.

2026-09-11 — Aiven special dinosaur model
- Visual thesis: the existing soft clay material carries an impossible dinosaur silhouette, with a purple T. rex torso, warm pink long neck, pale yellow horns and powder-blue paired plates. Content: one collectible model plus its collection silhouette; no new room UI. Interaction: reuse garden orbit, paint and gentle greeting morphs.
- Added a reproducible --only=aiven-chimera model target, unique catalog/icon and matching long-neck motion pivot. No fishing pool, pricing or reward logic changes in this visual task. Browser model verification pending.
- Visual validation complete: aiven-chimera.glb has 8,236 triangles, one mesh/draw and 307,840 bytes. Dedicated memory-only fixture and test cover complete finite geometry, body/accent/fixed paint channels, 320/390/1100 px, portrait/garden modes, recolouring, orbit, greeting and reduced motion. All 6 screenshots inspected; no browser errors. Official game client rerun clean after adding a fixture favicon; final canvas/state inspected. Existing dinosaur garden/play/placement/activities tests: 33 passed.
- Integration handoff: DINO_CATALOG/dinoDefinition/defaultDinoPaint, DinoIcon and /dino-models/aiven-chimera.glb are ready. Root handles event-only species lookup, granting/collecting and story reveal. The model does not enter the random fishing pool.


## 2026-09-11 — SAR 个人线

2026-09-11 — SAR NPC roster
- Visual thesis: a warm-white mobile character archive, using existing emotional portraits as the dominant art and restrained sand/gold accents. Content: Collection/Roster navigation, two residents, five-star progress, full supplied profiles, and replay records grouped by events/topics/easter eggs. Interaction: simple NPC/content switching, folding rank lists, and replay through the root callback; reduced motion omits entry transitions.
- Roster is global user progress, independent of the warehouse owner selector. Only completed scenes are replayable, locked labels omit scene titles and four/five-star stories remain unopened. Collection back chain and focus restoration wired; scoped browser validation in progress.
- Roster verified: dedicated browser tests pass full supplied profiles, local portraits, 5-star display, completed-only callbacks, locked title secrecy, global owner independence, storage broadcast refresh, zero-progress state and 320/390/1100 px. Screenshots inspected; trimmed no hair from the portrait frame. Official game client final screenshot/state inspected with mode=sar-familiarity-roster and no errors.
- Real root smoke passes SAR NPC Caian C1-01 and Aiven A1-02, completion into the roster, same-day no repeat, root replay callback, unchanged replay progress/rewards/inventory and back to roster/collection/warehouse. No model calls or page errors. Existing collection+titles full browser regression also passes. Full tsc retains baseline errors elsewhere; no diagnostics in SARFamiliarityRoster, SARCollectionView or new fixtures.
- Reported to root for consideration: on a 390x844 phone, the dialog stage leaves Aiven's third response below the initial viewport; it remains reachable by scrolling. No dialog/root edits made by this subtask.

2026-09-11 — SAR souvenir backup audit
- Full ZIP is covered by the existing v3 pipeline: collectSARLocalBackup is nested in backupData.sarLocalState, metadata serialization runs collectBlobRefs over the entire JSON (including pending and souvenir photo/member chibi tokens), writeBlobsToZip includes each token binary, and restoreBlobsFromZip restores original token IDs before restoreSARLocalBackup writes the references. No token rewrite is needed. DB.importFullData does not clear blob_assets; GC and token dedupe both enumerate all localStorage values.
- Fixed one text_only omission in OSContext: sarLocalState now passes through the existing recursive stripBase64, so this media-free export cannot retain dead photo/member blobref pointers or embedded images. Actual production strip function and assignment were extracted/transpiled and executed against nested pending photo, membership, souvenir photo and legacy data:image; every image was removed while progress, flags, names, positions/scales, coupons and original live data remained intact. Report: output/fishing-qa/npc-lines/text-only-sar-strip.json.
- Existing regression suites passed: fishingMarket34, dinosaurGarden14, sarCollection7, fishBackup2, sarEconomy13 (includes warehouse), backupFormat22, backupRoundtrip19 = 111 tests. No assertions were changed. The existing atlas-total assertion currently passes because the extra chimera and hidden egg cancel; notified root to add identity/egg unlock cases instead of relying on the fixed count.

- 截图：output/sar-room-layers；纯 CSS 调整，无需新增单测或改版本号。无待处理项。

### 2026-09-11 SAR 四档隐藏与钓鱼整理
- 视觉方向：青绿水面占主画面，保留简短天气/模式/抛竿和结果；说明进问号，角色邀请折叠。交互保留水纹、钓获浮现与模式切换，避免堆叠长说明。
- SAR 隐藏循环：名字称号 → 全文字 → 全角色小人（设施标记恢复）→ 恢复；旧 labelsHidden 档兼容映射第二档。

- 官方游戏客户端水面截图/state 已检查，无错误；完整 tsc 诊断与先前基线逐字相同，本次文件无新增诊断。截图目录 output/fishing-refresh，开发服务仍为 127.0.0.1:5173。
- 本轮无待处理实现项。

2026-09-11 — SAR conversation rules and shared presentation
- Removed the invented activity-room/fishing guide menus. Live headers show the NPC name; authored titles appear only in collection replay. Greetings and completed scenes exit directly; no farewell choice or immediate milestone button.
- Each NPC rolls at most one uncompleted current-tier topic per local day (80%). Aiven easters roll independently (20%), and conditional Sully encounters have a separate roll; simultaneous results wait for later clicks. Topic ten unlocks its milestone on the next visit.
- All interrupted scenes restart from the beginning with fresh choices, expressions and drafts. Reward-bearing nodes are staged for the current attempt; only complete scenes award progress and gifts atomically. Legacy receipts retain existing gifts and prevent duplicate grants.
- Initial meeting now shares the full-height cream stage and fixed bubble with daily dialogue. Choices follow the surrounding palette and keep their background on hover/focus; no purple selection state. Preserved central choices, cast continuity and the delayed embarrassed reaction.
- Verified 41 tests covering authored paths, independent rolls, daily limits, restart/stale advances, milestone timing, rewards, discounts and backup compatibility. Browser presentation suite passed 15 screenshots (320/390/1100 px); real-provider smoke and 23-scene interaction/keepsake suite passed with no page errors. TypeScript diagnostics exactly match the existing 10699-character baseline, with no new errors.
- User's main browser data was not seeded; all browser QA used isolated contexts. No commit, push or version bump.

2026-09-11 — SAR consistent portrait scale and unobstructed stage
- Removed the conversation header. Shared SARDialogueMeta places the current speaker, affinity stars, replay-only title and back button beside the dialogue. Kept the metadata outside the advance button so return and next remain separate accessible controls.
- Fixed the solo width constraint that made wide Caian art shrink after a two-person exchange. Solo/exchange now share identical stage-height sizing and native aspect ratios. Greetings use the same cast component, removing their separate 430px cap. Lowered both actors by 24px without resizing, naturally clipping the lower body at the dialogue edge.
- Reproduced two guest-flash cases with failing tests, then fixed both: opening transactions briefly exposed the previous guest before a restart; narration reused a departed guest as the visual speaker. Opening now gates intermediate storage snapshots; narration only retains a guest still staged for the exchange.
- 32 focused tests passed, including both new flicker regressions. Browser presentation suite passed 19 screenshots covering 320/390/1100 px, solo/exchange/solo image heights, both NPC greetings, metadata, replay, initial branches and the delayed embarrassed punchline. Standard skill browser client passed and final screenshots were visually inspected.

2026-09-11 — SAR two-person spacing adjustment
- Reduced both NPC portraits by 15% with the same scale in solo, greetings and exchanges. Removed the extra downward offset; the lower image edge stays anchored at the dialogue boundary so cropped-body artwork does not float.
- Kept the existing horizontal positions and staging logic; only shared portrait CSS changed.
- Verified 19 presentation screenshots and the standard game client; both layouts keep identical portrait scale, no page errors. Inspected the final phone exchange and desktop two-person screenshots.

2026-09-11 — SAR fixed backdrop, local settings, install clearance and roster
- Added SARDialogueBackdrop and shared the live room framing in sar-club-room.css. Initial meetings, normal dialogue and replay retain the full room image position/scale independently of the portrait stage.
- Moved SAR NPC preference and initial-meeting rewind out of the general participation page into Activity Room settings. Rewind confirmation now renders above settings, receives/restores focus, and has priority for back/Escape. Existing preference and intro state are reused.
- Raised module installation actions with 64px plus bottom safe area; buttons are at least 44px tall and icons/text are centered. Caian's roster portrait now uses normal.
- Browser QA passed: exact live/dialogue image geometry within 0.02px at 320/390/740/1100px, initial meeting, NPC preference persistence, rewind cancel/confirm, roster local normal.webp, and participation separation. Commerce suite passed including install button clearance at 390x844, 320x568 and 740x390. Dialogue suite passed all 19 screenshots; official game client screenshot and state inspected. No page errors.
- Full tsc output exactly matches the existing 10699-character baseline, no new diagnostics. No commit/push/version change; isolated browser contexts only.
- User raised output robustness while continuing to describe desired behavior. Interpreted as model-output format tolerance and graceful recovery; no new parser behavior has been changed in this pass. Await the rest of their examples/scope.

2026-09-11 — SAR module sticker alignment and adjacent output audit
- Reproduced the exact reported 11-bubble envelope: canonical normalized the historical sticker tag, surface did not, so the sticker text consumed bubble 10's surface slot and the last rewritten sentence was never attached. Both sides now use normalizeAiContent before parsing.
- Extended the audit with failing tests for copied HTML and five-field historical share cards, plus inline control tokens. Surface now excludes these with shared pure extractors; disabled-HTML placeholders do not consume speech slots. No surface directives or stickers execute or create duplicate messages.
- Unified full-width colon/lowercase SEND_EMOJI and named-sender history tags in assistantActionFormat, removing the duplicate reverse-tag normalizer. Verified omitted, missing, repeated and mixed-format stickers, quotations, omitted actions, bilingual/voice atomic blocks and final speech.
- 83 tests passed across post-processing, SAR runtime, request prompts and action normalization. Isolated browser fixture uses the real MessageItem and DB: 11 messages, sticker at 9, all 9 surface/truth switches correct, final sentences intact at 390/320px and after reload, no page errors or model calls. Existing saved user messages were not modified.
- Full tsc diagnostics for this change match the existing 10699-character baseline with no added errors. No commit, push or version change.


## 2026-09-11 — SAR release, backup, analytics and desktop integration
- Request: audit SAR / anniversary / global chat input backup, add Umami, replace Amsg2/collaboration startup announcements with a richer SAR-led release, and expose Kanata on three desktops.
- Added three-page illustrated SAR announcement, v3.9 (SAR), in-app changelog, seen-state backup compatibility and one-shot launch into SAR. Removed Amsg2/collaboration from startup queue; historical docs remain.
- Fixed missing global chat input preferences and SAR local preferences in Settings export/import. Full exports now extract/restore nested legacy SAR photos as assets; existing v3 blob sidecar carries embedded references. Backup no longer refreshes/rerolls saved module shop offers while reading an older date.
- Added explicit SAR feature analytics whitelist plus anniversary open/apply/save results; eight enum-only session snapshot dimensions. Extended poison tests and analytics documentation. Local development remains excluded by the existing analytics gate.
- Desktop replacements: MobileGameHome Archives → Kanata (illustrated planet), TamagotchiHome Pixel → Kanata, CompanionHome Music → Kanata.
- Actual isolated OSProvider exportSystem/importSystem roundtrip passed all three modes. Full mode compares gameplay/unfinished drafts/reward receipts/garden/inventory/runtime/message metadata/anniversary themes and decoded photo bytes. Text mode retains progress/preferences while removing custom photos; media-only does not reset gameplay/preferences.
- Unit regression: 43 files / 523 cases, initially 521 pass with two stale 1000-coin expectations in fishingSession. Updated expectations to current SAR_STARTING_BALANCE without changing product balances; rerun of fishingSession + chat input/auto-reply passes 36/36. Analytics/privacy checks pass 100/100.
- Browser: 320/390/1100 announcement pages, old queue suppression, actual FAQ/SAR CTA dispatch; SAR room/dialogue background/settings/rewind/install/roster checks pass. Existing skill game client passes initial dialogue. Screenshots/reports under output/sar-release*, output/sar-desktop-entry and output/sar-room-polish.
- pnpm build succeeded. TypeScript report output/sar-release-tsc.log exactly matches prior 10699-character baseline: no new diagnostics; unrelated existing errors remain.
- No user browser data was modified; all seed/import tests use isolated browser contexts.

2026-09-11 — Module display and lifecycle follow-up
- Replaced the glowing dot/hidden paragraph taps with labeled SAR speech switches. Date reading/GAL state is independent; repeat lines and original-text resume snapshots resolve by batch position.
- Added global draggable/collapsible module monitor listing every character and the user. Early end starts three recovery reminders and persists endReason; same-run/same-phase reply guards prevent stale requests restoring effects or consuming the first end notice. Enum-only Umami end event.
- Verified 49 postprocessing, 20 runtime, 12 payload, 5 backup, 6 presentation, 28 Date regression, 3 analytics tests; isolated real-store Chat and Date browser scripts passed at 320/390 px, no model calls or page errors. Production build passed. Typecheck retains pre-existing errors; no new module diagnostics.
- Next user steering: simple fishing should have shadows/casting/empty outcomes, paginate and group cabinet and warehouse, vary daily greeting expressions, and introduce every facility with NPC-led first-visit help.

2026-09-11 — Facility guides, paged collections and simple fishing
- Redesigned the cabinet as a compact per-character library. Character group/search plus eight avatars per page; six records/notes per page, selected character survives view changes. Character-owned notes are read only for the selected owner, replacing the all-character DB fan-out.
- Warehouse now shows twelve item types per page, resets scrolling and selection when paging/filtering, and labels the user owner simply 我.
- Simple fishing now has a swimming shadow, forgiving cast target, animated bobber/wait/reel phases and an empty outcome. Only successful completed catches enter inventory; failed saves can retry without duplicating catches. Manual play remains available.
- Added question-mark help to all seven facilities, with expanded first-visit NPC introductions: Aiven for fishing/dinosaurs, Caian for the other facilities. Seen flags join SAR backup/restore. Daily greeting expressions vary by sentence while authored scene expressions remain intact.
- Validation: 11 files / 101 related tests passed. Real components + OSProvider + isolated DB browser fixture passed with sixty custom characters: eight visible avatars, six records, twelve warehouse entries, lazy notes, restored selection, both daily greeting expression sequences, seven guides and caught/empty inventory checks. No model calls or page errors. Inspected phone/320px/forge/guide/fishing screenshots. Official game client completed three snapshots with no errors; final caught state and screenshot inspected.
- Production build passed; git diff --check passed (line-ending warnings only). Final typecheck diagnostics match the existing 10699-character baseline; no new errors. All user profile data stayed untouched. No commit or push.
- Final robustness follow-up: selected-owner note read failures now render a distinct error with retry instead of an empty-cabinet state; stale requests cannot replace the current result. The isolated browser suite passed injected read failure -> visible alert -> retry -> recovery, and its final screenshot was inspected.
- Final production rebuild passed after the note-read retry fix (56.12s); final TypeScript diagnostics exactly match the 10699-character baseline.

2026-09-11 — Dinosaur wording cleanup
- Unified the four remaining legacy dinosaur labels to 橡皮泥恐龙 across Caian topic/title dialogue and Aiven catch/record narration. Repository-wide source/copy scan found no remaining old dinosaur wording; diff whitespace check passed. Copy-only change, no gameplay or version changes.

2026-09-11 — Warehouse pagination visibility
- Moved warehouse paging above the item grid and kept it sticky while scrolling. Shows filtered record count, twelve entries per page and page index; a non-empty single page keeps disabled navigation visible. Owner and category changes still reset the page.
- Verified an isolated real-store fixture with sixty-six entries: twelve rendered per page, six-page navigation including the final six entries, sticky mobile controls, owner/filter resets, empty state and 320px layout. Standard game client also passed; mobile/desktop/sticky screenshots and state inspected, no page errors. Shared pager defaults remain unchanged for other facilities.

2026-09-11 — master alignment and final SAR fixes
- Checkpoint b87f5f97 preserves all branch changes before merging origin/master (27987fbb). Resolved nine conflicts, retaining master context/history cleanup, worker updates and this branch's SAR, chat controls, anniversary and backups. Master was fetched again at completion and is unchanged.
- Fixed the announcement portrait overlap on 320px/390px screens. Version is v3.10 (SAR), following master's v3.9.2.
- Split SAR/chat-input preferences into the fifth mutually exclusive analytics snapshot slot; preserve old event payload limits and exactly one cold-start snapshot. Nine SAR fields now include the explicit board model permission.
- Corrected Instant Push route selection: SAR's local route also runs local emotion evaluation; frozen config, reply locks and delivery semantics are preserved.
- Gacha rendering: extracted static styles, memoized artwork, paged eight modules, eliminated animated filters, paused covered/background animation, and ignored identical market snapshots. Isolated comparison: 25 -> 8 mounted cards; 567 -> 201 collection DOM nodes; 20 unchanged refreshes caused 20 -> 0 React commits; help overlay running animations 8 -> 0. Both pools, capsule/reveal/detail, wallet, duplicate clicks, cross-tab race and storage failure were checked.
- Module monitor now lists active effects only. Ending all modules hides it, including after reload, while the afterglow/next-reply release instructions persist. A new installation makes it reappear. Real OS + Date browser regression passed.
- Board now has manual refresh for two or three local NPCs, or a roaming character ONLY after an explicit SAR setting permits models. Default/invalid/missing settings disable all board model generation; manual invitation and the session runner have the same gate. Removed old half-hour visitor pulse. Existing posts, comments, inventories and finite wallets are retained. Permission is in SAR backup and fixed-enum analytics.
- Validation: full 426-file / 5,061-case suite run; the final parallel run had six timeout/cascading-lock failures in three heavy suites, all 91 cases passed when rerun with one worker. Earlier merge source-guard failures were fixed and their seven-suite / 147-case follow-up passed. New/affected board, runtime, backup and analytics tests: 120 passed. Release UI (320/390/1100), full/text/media export-import, merged real Chat settings, seven facility guides, 60-character cabinet, warehouse pages, fishing, board opt-in and global module monitor browser checks passed. Standard game client captured the actual gacha capsule and matching state with no browser error report.
- Final pnpm build passed. TypeScript diagnostics match the pre-merge baseline exactly after normalizing line numbers (10,699-character baseline); no new diagnostics.
- All work is local on codex/dino-cafe-art; no push or publication to master has been performed.

2026-09-11 — board refresh / specified-character clarification
- Removed the redundant board-specific model switch, permission gate, backup preference and analytics field. Random character visits now reuse Kanata's existing free-roaming participation setting; specified-character invitations reuse the established manual activity pipeline, including manual-only characters.
- Exposed "指定角色" beside "刷新" on the board. Its existing selection page returns directly to the board when entered there. Added an immediate shared guard for refresh/invite double clicks.
- Updated guide copy and regressions. 97 targeted tests passed. Isolated browser checks verified NPC and roaming-character refreshes, explicit invitation of a manual-only character, duplicate-click protection, direct return navigation, 320px layout and absence of the extra permission setting. Standard client state and screenshots also verified.
- Production build passed (1m 12s).

2026-09-11 — collection names, Aiven fish sales and exclusive keepsakes (in progress)
- Collection owner labels now resolve current profile names; old fish/dinosaur owner snapshots no longer leak user IDs. Fish catalog, live renames and dinosaur origin/detail browser checks passed.
- Added sell disposition + optional saleWords to the same character fishing response. Actual daily price, quality premium, shared daily buyback quota and wallet bounds are verified atomically. Saved Aiven reply/expression and payment survive delivery retries and SAR backup; user fish detail and character activity/chat cards show the receipt. Five authored replies use local assets without a model call.
- Added Collection -> Exclusive keepsakes shelf over existing earned souvenirs and story-only dinosaur collection history. NPC filters, twelve/page, original photo replay and no reward replay. Fixed focus loss after filtering so Escape returns properly.
- Relevant suite: 9 files / 100 tests passed; name, fish-sale, keepsakes browser scripts passed. Standard client captured collection navigation and state with no errors. TypeScript diagnostic output matches pre-existing baseline exactly (10,699 bytes). Build not yet run for these changes.
- Latest user asks to greatly refine Caian artifacts visually. Current next work: redesign membership/admin cards, meeting record, photo presentation and memory card plus collection previews; preserve original saved photo geometry, identity snapshots, progress and reward logic.
- Art direction: Caian's carefully filed keepsakes; ivory paper, deep ink and a restrained brass accent. Content: a dominant physical object, then its original note and provenance, then return. Interaction: brief object entrance, photo front/back reveal, subtle card lift on pointer devices; respect reduced motion.
- Concurrent changes in components/os/AnniversaryGiftPopup.tsx, utils/anniversaryGifts.ts and docs/anniversary-gifts.md are not ours; preserve and exclude from our commit.

- 用户纠正演出方向：保持完整立绘＋对话，物品只在真正拿出时进入前景，下一句收起；使用逐节点 authored effectLine，避免凯恩翻找卡片、艾文收线时提前泄露物品。保留收藏页实物样式。手机前景限制在立绘下半部，不移动房间和人物。
- 应用户要求，开发服务的名册临时开放两位 NPC 各三个星级事件；通过 DEV 门禁的内存预览运行交互，不修改实际进度或发奖，正式构建不开放。

- 验证：新增物品前景组件始终保留原立绘 DOM；凯恩翻找时不展示，实际拿出时显示，下一行收起，存档刷新不会重新出现；带选项的展示先收起再选择。320/390 手机截图、五种实物、证件确认、照片翻面与展开构图均检查。
- 六段开发预览经真实图鉴 → 名册入口完整读完（C1 21、C2 117、C3 106、A1 13、A2 26、A3 39 次操作），逐段比较存档完全相同；生产门禁通过 esbuild 置 DEV=false 实测仍锁定。
- 回归：售鱼/会话/价格/收藏/解析 73 个测试、星级事件/边界/优惠/整包备份 33 个测试通过；原个人线浏览器集成通过；标准 web-game client 的台词状态与截图无异常。最终 pnpm build 成功（43.13s），git diff --check 无问题。
- 保留并排修改：周年庆三处文件，以及 AppErrorBoundary、preloadableLazy、chunkLoadRecovery 和对应测试；未将它们当成本次 SAR 修改覆盖。

- 最终全量 tsc 已结束：本次 SAR 文件无新增类型错误；原有基线错误仍在，另有并排修改的 utils/preloadableLazy.test.ts 中 caught 为 unknown（TS18046）。没有把全量类型检查记为通过。

- 本轮：证件清晰度、SAR 句末标点、凯恩三个星级事件的逐句表情重配，移除手动接入额外提示词并加入公共 SAR/两人介绍。视觉仍是立绘＋纸质道具，文字清晰优先；卡片正向排版，以卡片、身份信息、确认按钮为层次；保留轻淡入、合照翻面和构图展开，取消会模糊文本的旋转/整层滤镜。

- 本轮完成：凯恩七种、艾文六种表情按固定剧情逐句编排，六段星级事件逐句检查无连续超过三句同表情；长句支持 sentenceExpressions，存档与回顾保留末句表情，凯恩平常更多 normal，拆台后才 embarrassed。陈述句补齐句号，问号/感叹号/停顿与动作原样保留。
- 接入提示词：移除额外手动活动段落，统一加入 SAR 与两位管理员的公共介绍；不改手动/自动调度；公共介绍不虚构相识或星级私密经历。修正用户当前 SAR 房间名，钓鱼活动说明包含售鱼给艾文。
- 实物支持点击或放大按钮打开独立只读详情，完整查看与关闭不确认领取、不推进台词；Escape 只关详情并恢复焦点。证件取消整层滤镜与旋转，按钮保留在纸卡下方，放大入口放左侧避开脸部。
- 艾文礼炮参考周年开屏的全屏散落方式，改为 document.body Portal，56 片有限 CSS 粒子覆盖视口，不占物品窗口、不挡点击，减少动态效果时隐藏；离开礼炮节点清除。
- 验证：10 个相关测试文件先通过 81 项，补充表情/标点/公共介绍测试后相关两文件 22 项通过（合计 86 项）；物品放大/不误确认/焦点返回/全屏礼炮/节点清理浏览器检查通过；五种实物、证件确认、合照翻面和 320/390 布局回归通过；标准 web-game client 完成并检查截图。pnpm build 成功；全量 tsc 仍是既有错误与并行 preloadableLazy 测试错误，本轮文件无新增类型错误。

- 收藏图鉴主题修正：统一为随全局主色变化的浅底、正文、次要文字、分隔线和强调色；导航继承当前页背景，收藏、专属纪念、名册共用主题变量，消除绿底配棕色提示条的割裂。保留物品材质和角色原画颜色；只调整配色，原有切换/展开动画不变。

2026-09-12 — Aiven RPG fish-sales entry
- User correction: clicking Aiven starts normal dialogue immediately. Services appear only after greeting/story; star-event completion keeps a separate end page before services. Replay never offers selling. Weekday greeting comes first for Aiven.
- Verified browser greeting, after-dialogue sale payout, live star ending, replay, and 37 unit checks. Dinosaur GLB base-path hotfix separately deployed (PR 641).
